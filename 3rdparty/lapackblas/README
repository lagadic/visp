LAPACK is a library of Fortran 90 with subroutines for solving
the most commonly occurring problems in numerical linear algebra.
It is freely-available software, and is copyrighted.

LAPACK is available on netlib and can be obtained via the World Wide
Web and anonymous ftp.

   http://www.netlib.org/lapack/

The distribution tar file contains the Fortran source for LAPACK and the
testing programs.  It also contains the Fortran77
reference implementation of the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
(the Level 1, 2, and 3 BLAS) needed by LAPACK.  However this code is
intended for use only if there is no other implementation of the BLAS
already available on your machine; the efficiency of LAPACK depends
very much on the efficiency of the BLAS.

=================
LAPACK INSTALLATION:
 - LAPACK can be installed with make. Configuration have to be set in the
 make.inc file. A make.inc.example for a Linux machine running GNU compilers
 is given in the main directory. Some specific make.inc are also available in
 the INSTALL directory
 - LAPACK includes also the CMAKE build. You will need to have CMAKE installed
 on your machine (CMAKE is available at http://www.cmake.org/). CMAKE will allow
 an easy installation on a Windows Machine
 - Specific information to run LAPACK under Windows are available at
 http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/

 For further information on LAPACK please read our FAQ at
 http://www.netlib.org/lapack/#_faq
 A User forum is also available to help you with the LAPACK library at
 http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/

================
LAPACK User Support

LAPACK has been thoroughly tested, on many different
types of computers.  The LAPACK project supports the package in the
sense that reports of errors or poor performance will gain immediate
attention from the developers. Such reports, descriptions
of interesting applications, and other comments should be sent by
electronic mail to lapack@cs.utk.edu.

A list of known problems, bugs, and compiler errors for LAPACK is
maintained on netlib.
  http://www.netlib.org/lapack/release_notes.html

A User forum is also available to help you with the LAPACK library at
 http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/
You can also contact directly the LAPACK team at lapack@cs.utk.edu
================


================
LAPACK TESTING
The complete package, including test code in four
different Fortran data types (real, complex, double precision, double
complex), contains some 805,000 lines of Fortran source and comments.
You will need approximately 33 Mbytes to read the complete tape.
We recommend that you run the testing.  The total
space requirements for the testing for all four data
types, including the object files, is approximately 80 Mbytes.

A README file containing the information in this letter is located
in the LAPACK directory. Postscript and LaTeX versions of the Quick
Installation Guide are in the LAPACK/INSTALL directory, in the files
lawn81.tex, psfig.tex, lawn81.ps, and org2.ps.  Consult the Installation
Guide for further details on installing the package and on what is contained
in each subdirectory.  For complete information on the LAPACK Testing
please consult LAPACK Working Note 41 "Installation
Guide for LAPACK".

================
LAPACK USER GUIDE
It is highly recommended that you obtain a copy of the Third Edition of
the LAPACK Users' Guide published by SIAM in Winter, 1999.  This Users'
Guide gives a detailed description of the philosophy behind LAPACK as well
as an explanation of its usage.  The LAPACK Users' Guide can be purchased from:
SIAM; Customer Service; P. O. Box 7260; Philadelphia, PA 19104;
215-382-9800, FAX 215-386-7999.  It will also be available from booksellers.

To order by email, send email to service@siam.org.  The book is also
available via SIAM's World Wide Web URL at http://www.siam.org.  The
ISBN number is 0-89871-447-8, and SIAM order code is SE09.  The list
price for SIAM members is $31.20; the cost for nonmembers is $39.00.

RELATED LAPACK PROJECTS

The Fortran95 interface to LAPACK is available, as well as an f2c'ed
version of LAPACK, and a C++ version of a subset of LAPACK routines.

LAPACK WORKING NOTES

A number of technical reports were written during the development of
LAPACK and published as LAPACK Working Notes, initially by Argonne
National Laboratory and later by the University of Tennessee.  Many of
these reports later appeared as journal articles.  Most of these working
notes are available in pdf and postscript form from netlib.
