Porting of the AprilTag library: https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag.html
AprilTag version is 2016-12-01 (0.9.8).

Changes / modifications made:
  - scale directly the pose computed in homography_to_pose() (homography.c)
    by the marker size
  - we observed that the pose returned by homography_to_pose() is left-handed,
    we add a transformation to get a right-handed pose

Windows porting (MinGW):
  - see commit 4f5d150 and previous
  - use C99 flag
