This driver was inspired from Reflex Takktile 1 driver available from https://github.com/RightHandRobotics/reflex-api.

It was adapted by Fabien Spindler to work with Reflex Takktile 2 hand from Right Hand Robotics.

Main changes:
- remove boost dependency and use rather std::function and std::bind
- adapt preprocessor macro to Reflex Takktile 2 hand
