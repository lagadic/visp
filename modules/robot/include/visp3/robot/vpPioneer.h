  \brief Generic functions for Pioneer mobile robots.

  This class provides common features for Pioneer mobile robots.
  This robot has two control velocities \f$(v_x, w_z)\f$, the translational
  and rotational velocities of the mobile platform respectively.

  The figure below shows the position of the frames that are used to model the
  robot. The end effector frame is here located at the middle point between
  the two wheels.

  The robot jacobian at the end effector frame, the point located at the
  middle between the two wheels is given by:

  \f[
  {^e}{\bf J}_e = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
  1  &   0   \\
  0  &   0   \\
  0  &   0   \\
  0  &   0   \\
  0  &   0   \\
  0  &   1   \\
  \end{array}
  \right)
  \f]

  Considering \f$(v_x, w_z)\f$, it is possible to compute \f$\bf v\f$ the six
  dimention velocity skew expressed at the end effector frame by:

  \f[
  {\bf v} = {^e}{\bf J}_e \;
  \left(\begin{array}{c}
  v_x \\
  w_z \\
  \end{array}
  \right)
  \f].
