 * \example testPixhawkDroneVelocityControl.cpp
 *
 * This code shows how to takeoff, control in velocity and land with a drone
 * equipped with a Pixhawk connected to a Jetson TX2 that runs this test using ViSP.
 * The drone is localized thanks to Qualisys Mocap. Communication between the Jetson
 * and the Pixhawk is based on Mavlink using MAVSDK 3rd party.
