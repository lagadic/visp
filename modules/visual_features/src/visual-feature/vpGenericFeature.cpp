  \exception if errorHasBeenInitialized is true (that is if

  since the error HAS TO BE recomputed at each iteration
  errorHasBeenInitialized is set to errHasToBeUpdated if

  thrown

  obviously if vpGenericFeature::setError is not used then s_star is
  considered and this warning is meaningless.

    the second one set select to vpBasicFeature::FEATURE_LINE[1], and
