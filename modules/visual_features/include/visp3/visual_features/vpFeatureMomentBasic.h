  \brief Functionality computation for basic moment feature. Computes the
  interaction matrix associated with vpMomentBasic.

  The interaction matrix for the basic moment feature is defined in
  \cite Tahri05z, equation (13). This vpFeatureMoment, as well as it's
  corresponding moment primitive is double-indexed. The interaction matrix \f$
  L_{m_{ij}} \f$ is obtained by calling vpFeatureMomentBasic::interaction
  (i,j) and is associated to \f$ m_{ij} \f$ obtained by vpMomentBasic::get
  (i,j). vpFeatureMomentBasic computes interaction matrices all interaction
  matrices up to vpMomentObject::getOrder()-1. \attention The maximum order
  reached by vpFeatureMomentBasic is NOT the maximum order of the
  vpMomentObject, it is one unit smaller. For example if you define your
  vpMomentObject up to order n then vpFeatureMomentBasic will be able to
  compute interaction matrices up to order n-1 that is \f$ L_{m_{ij}} \f$ with
  \f$ i+j<=n-1 \f$.

    You can see an example of vpFeatureMomentBasic by looking at the
  documentation of the vpFeatureMoment class.

    This feature depends on:
        - vpMomentBasic
