  \brief Class that defines a 2D line visual feature \f$ s\f$ which is
  composed by two parameters that are \f$ \rho \f$ and \f$ \theta \f$,
  the polar coordinates of a line.

  In this class, the equation of the line in the image plane is given by :
  \f[ x \; cos(\theta) + y \; sin(\theta) -\rho = 0 \f] Here
  \f$ x \f$ and \f$ y \f$ are the coordinates of a point belonging to
  the line and they are given in meter. The following image shows the
  meanings of the distance \f$\rho\f$ and the angle \f$\theta\f$.

  \image html vpFeatureLine.gif
  \image latex vpFeatureLine.ps  width=10cm

  You have to note that the \f$ \theta \f$ angle has its value between
  \f$ -\pi \f$ and \f$ \pi \f$ and that the \f$ \rho \f$ distance can
  be positive or negative. The conventions are illustrated by the
  image above.

  The visual features can be set easily from an instance of the
  classes vpLine, vpMeLine or vpCylinder. For more precision see the
  class vpFeatureBuilder.

  Once the values of the visual features are set, the interaction()
  method allows to compute the interaction matrix \f$ L \f$ associated
  to the visual feature, while the error() method computes the error
  vector \f$(s - s^*)\f$ between the current visual feature and the
  desired one.

  The code below shows how to create a eye-in hand visual servoing
  task using a 2D line feature \f$(\rho,\theta)\f$ that correspond to
  the 2D equation of a line in the image plan. To control six
  degrees of freedom, at least four other features must be considered
  like two other line features for example. First we create a current
  (\f$s\f$) 2D line feature. Then we set the task to use the
  interaction matrix associated to the current feature \f$L_s\f$. And
  finally we compute the camera velocity \f$v=-\lambda \; L_s^+ \;
  (s-s^*)\f$. The current feature \f$s\f$ is updated in the while()
  loop.

  \code
#include <visp3/visual_features/vpFeatureLine.h>
#include <visp3/vs/vpServo.h>

int main()
{
  vpServo task; // Visual servoing task

  vpFeatureLine sd; //The desired line feature.
  //Sets the desired features rho and theta
  double rhod = 0;
  double thetad = 0;
  //Sets the parameters which describe the equation of a plan in the camera frame : AX+BY+CZ+D=0.
  //The line described by the features belongs to this plan.
  //Normally two plans are needed to describe a line. But to compute the interaction matrix only
  //one equation of the two plans is needed.
  //Notes that the Dd value must not be equal to zero !
  double Ad = 0;
  double Bd = 0;
  double Cd = 1;
  double Dd = -1;
  //Set the line feature thanks to the desired parameters.
  sd.buildfrom(rhod, thetad, Ad,Bd, Cd, Dd);

  vpFeatureLine s; //The current line feature.
  //Sets the current features rho and theta
  double rho;  //You have to compute the value of rho.
  double theta;  //You have to compute the value of theta.
  //Set the line feature thanks to the current parameters.
  s.buildfrom(rho, theta);
  //In this case the parameters A, B, C, D are not needed because the interaction matrix is computed
  //with the desired visual feature.

  // Set eye-in-hand control law.
  // The computed velocities will be expressed in the camera frame
  task.setServo(vpServo::EYEINHAND_CAMERA);
  // Interaction matrix is computed with the desired visual features sd
  task.setInteractionMatrixType(vpServo::DESIRED);

  // Add the 2D line feature to the task
  task.addFeature(s, sd);

  // Control loop
  for ( ; ; ) {
    // The new parameters rho and theta must be computed here.

    // Update the current line visual feature
    s.buildfrom(rho, theta);

    // compute the control law
    vpColVector v = task.computeControlLaw(); // camera velocity
  }
  return 0;
}
  \endcode

  If you want to build your own control law, this other example shows how to
create a current (\f$s\f$) and desired (\f$s^*\f$) 2D line visual feature,
compute the corresponding error vector \f$(s-s^*)\f$ and finally build the
interaction matrix \f$L_s\f$.

  \code
#include <visp3/core/vpMatrix.h>
#include <visp3/visual_features/vpFeatureLine.h>

int main()
{
  vpFeatureLine sd; //The desired line feature.
  //Sets the desired features rho and theta
  double rhod = 0;
  double thetad = 0;
  //Sets the parameters which describe the equation of a plan in the camera frame : AX+BY+CZ+D=0.
  double Ad = 0; double Bd = 0; double Cd = 1; double Dd = -1;
  //Set the line feature thanks to the desired parameters.
  sd.buildfrom(rhod, thetad, Ad,Bd, Cd, Dd);

  vpFeatureLine s; //The current line feature.
  //Sets the current features rho and theta
  double rho;  //You have to compute the value of rho.
  double theta;  //You have to compute the value of theta.
  //Sets the parameters which describe the equation of a plan in the camera frame : AX+BY+CZ+D=0.
  double A;  //You have to compute the value of A.
  double B;  //You have to compute the value of B.
  double C;  //You have to compute the value of C.
  double D;  //You have to compute the value of D. D must not be equal to zero !
  //Set the line feature thanks to the current parameters.
  s.buildfrom(rho, theta, A, B, C, D);

  // Compute the interaction matrix L_s for the current line feature
  vpMatrix L = s.interaction();
  // You can also compute the interaction matrix L_s for the desired line feature
  // The corresponding line of code is : vpMatrix L = sd.interaction();

  // Compute the error vector (s-sd) for the line feature
  s.error(s_star);
}
