  \class vpPclViewer
  \ingroup group_gui_plotter
  This class enables real time plotting of 3D point clouds. It relies on the PCL library. To see how to install PCL library,
  please refer to the \ref soft_tool_pcl section.
  You can either plot in a non-blocking threaded manner or in a blocking manner.
  The point clouds can be displayed using their original colors, or using uniform colors to match
  a legend.
  Additionally, it is possible to use confidence weights to hide points that are not trusted. These
  weights can result from a robust estimation using for instance the vpRobust class.

  \warning If you face some runtime errors with the following class, please refer to the \ref pcl_viewer_known_issues
  section to see if it is a known problem.
