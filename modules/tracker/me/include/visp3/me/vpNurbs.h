 *
 * \brief Class that provides tools to compute and manipulate a Non Uniform
 * Rational B-Spline curve.
 *
 * The different parameters are :
 *
 * - The knot vector \f$ U = {u_0, ... , u_m} \f$ where the knots \f$ u_i, i =
 * 0, ...,m \f$ are real number such as \f$ u_i < u_{i+1} i = 0, ...,m \f$. To
 * define a curve, the knot vector is such as : \f$ U = {a , ... , a, u_{p+1} ,
 * ... , u_{m-p-1} , b , ... , b} \f$ where \f$ a \f$ and \f$ b \f$ are real
 * numbers and p is the degree of the B-Spline basis functions.
 *
 * - The B-Spline basis functions \f$ N_{i,p} \f$ defined as :
 * \f[ N_{i,0}(u) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
 * 1 & \mbox{if } u_i \leq u_{i+1} \\ 0 & else
 * \end{array}\right.\f]
 *
 * \f[ N_{i,p}(u) =
 * \frac{u-u_i}{u_{i+p}-u_i}N_{i,p-1}(u)+\frac{u_{i+p+1}-u}{u_{i+p+1}-u_{i+1}}N_{i+1,p-1}(u)\f]
 *
 * where \f$ i = 0 , ... , m-1 \f$ and p is the degree of the B-Spline basis
 * functions.
 *
 * - The control points \f$ {P_i} \f$ which are defined by the coordinates \f$
 * (i,j) \f$ of a point in an image.
 *
 * - The weight \f$ {w_i} \f$ associated to each control points. The weights
 * value is upper than 0.
 *
 * It is possible to compute the coordinates of a point corresponding to the
 * knots \f$ u \f$ (\f$ u \in [u_0,u_m]\f$) thanks to the formula : \f[ C(u) =
 * \frac{\sum_{i=0}^n (N_{i,p}(u)w_iP_i)}{\sum_{i=0}^n (N_{i,p}(u)w_i)}\f]
 *
 * You can find much more information about the B-Splines and the
 * implementation of all the methods in the Nurbs Book.
