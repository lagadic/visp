  \class vpUniRand

  \ingroup group_core_random
  \brief Class for generating random numbers with uniform probability density.

  The algorithms and notations used are described in \cite oneill:pcg2014.

  The following example also available in random.cpp shows how to use this class to generate 10 numbers between 0 and 5.
  \include random.cpp

  Once build, this previous code should produces an output similar to the following:
  \code

  Original vector = [	0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9 ]
