  \brief This class implements the Hinkley's cumulative sum test.

  \author Fabien Spindler (Fabien.Spindler@irisa.fr), Irisa / Inria Rennes

  The Hinkley's cumulative sum test is designed to detect jump in mean
  of an observed signal \f$ s(t) \f$. It is known to be robust (by
  taking into account all the past of the observed quantity),
  efficient, and inducing a very low computational load. The other
  attractive features of this test are two-fold. First, it can
  straightforwardly and accurately provide the jump instant. Secondly,
  due to its formulation (cumulative sum test), it can simultaneously
  handle both very abrupt and important changes, and gradual smaller
  ones without adapting the involved thresholds.

  Two tests are performed in parallel to look for downwards or upwards
  jumps in \f$ s(t) \f$, respectively defined by:

  \f[ S_k = \sum_{t=0}^{k} (s(t) - m_0 + \frac{\delta}{2}) \f]
  \f[ M_k = \max_{0 \leq i \leq k} S_i\f]
  \f[ T_k = \sum_{t=0}^{k} (s(t) - m_0 - \frac{\delta}{2}) \f]
  \f[ N_k = \max_{0 \leq i \leq k} T_i\f]

  In which \f$m_o\f$ is computed on-line and corresponds to the mean
  of the signal \f$ s(t) \f$ we want to detect a jump. \f$m_o\f$ is
  re-initialized at zero after each jump detection. \f$\delta\f$
  denotes the jump minimal magnitude that we want to detect and
  \f$\alpha\f$ is a predefined threshold. These values are set by
  default to 0.2 in the default constructor vpHinkley(). To modify the
  default values use setAlpha() and setDelta() or the
  vpHinkley(double alpha, double delta) constructor.

  A downward jump is detected if \f$ M_k - S_k > \alpha \f$.
  A upward jump is detected if \f$ T_k - N_k > \alpha \f$.

  To detect only downward jumps in \f$ s(t) \f$ use
  testDownwardJump().To detect only upward jumps in \f$ s(t) \f$ use
  testUpwardJump(). To detect both, downard and upward jumps use
  testDownUpwardJump().

  If a jump is detected, the jump location is given by the last instant
  \f$k^{'}\f$ when \f$ M_{k^{'}} - S_{k^{'}} = 0 \f$, or \f$ T_{k^{'}} -
  N_{k^{'}} = 0 \f$.
