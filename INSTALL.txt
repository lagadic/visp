INSTALL howto for the ViSP library

QUICKINSTALL: 
> get ViSP source
> install CMake (see http://www.cmake.org)
> cmake .
> make
> make install

The make install step is needed if you want to use ViSP in your own
projects. To do the installation, you don't need to be root.


Building ViSP with CMake
------------------------

Prerequsits: 
(1) Install newest cmake release from http://www.cmake.org

(2) checkout/install ViSP source code.

(3) configure 
run cmake to change options and to generate makefiles. 

example for a build on Linux:
cd to source directory of ViSP
> cd ViSP
To configure and generate makefiles:

On Linux:
> ccmake . (mind the 'dot')
See the bottom line for usage instructions, in particular:
- press 'c', then modify options as required and press 'c' again to configure
- finally press 'g' to generate Makefiles

On Win32:
> CMakeSetup.exe 
The GUI is self-explaining.

Note:
You can also use 
 > cmake .
directly if you prefer command line instead of graphical interface.


(4) compile:
> make

(5) install:
> make install
Copy headers in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/visp
Copy library in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib
Copy visp-config shell script in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin

(6) uninstall:
> make uninstall
Dual from install.
Remove headers in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/visp
Remove library and cmake files in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib 
Remove visp-config shell script in ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin

(7) clean:
> make clean
The "make clean" target will remove files generated by the compiler and linker.

(8) distclean:  
> sh ./distclean.sh 
CMake does not generate a "make distclean" target (see the cmake FAQ).  CMake
generates many files related to the build system, but since CMakeLists.txt
files can run scripts and other arbitrary commands, there is no way it can keep
track of exactly which files are generated as part of running CMake.  So we
have developped a distclean shell script (working under Unix platforms) that
removes these files related to the build system.

(8) documentation
> make html-doc
Generate doxygen html documentation in doc/html.

See README.txt for further information.
