QUICKINSTALL: 
> get ViSP source
> install CMake (see http://www.cmake.org)
> cmake .

The make install step is needed if you want to use ViSP in your own
projects. To do the installation, you don't need to be root.


Building ViSP with CMake
------------------------

Prerequsits: 
(1) Install newest cmake release from http://www.cmake.org

(2) checkout/install ViSP source code.

(3) configure 
run cmake to change options and to generate makefiles. 

example for a build on Linux:
cd to source directory of ViSP
> cd ViSP
To configure and generate makefiles:

On Linux:
> ccmake . (mind the 'dot')
See the bottom line for usage instructions, in particular:
- press 'c', then modify options as required and press 'c' again to configure
- finally press 'g' to generate Makefiles

On Win32:
> CMakeSetup.exe 
The GUI is self-explaining.
