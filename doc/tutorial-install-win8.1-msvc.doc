\page tutorial-install-win81-msvc Tutorial: Installation from source on Windows 8.1 with Visual C++ 2013
\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on Windows 8.1 with Visual C++. These steps have been tested on Windows 8.1 (64 bit), with CMake 3.1.1 and Visual Studio Express 2013 but should work with any other version as well. 

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_win81_msvc_required Required packages

- Visual Studio C++. Note that ViSP can also be build with Visual Studio Express that could be downloaded from  http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products In this tutorial we use Visual Studio Express 2013. 
\note If you want to use Visual Studio Express, you have to install <b>Express 2013 for Windows Desktop</b>. The \b Desktop version is important to work with CMake.
- CMake 2.8 or higher that could be download at : http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html


\section install_win81_msvc_get_source Getting ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code.

\subsection install_win81_msvc_get_source_release Getting the latest release

You can download the <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/download.html#latest">latest stable release</a> as a zip. 

\subsection install_win81_msvc_get_source_snapshot Getting the latest snapshot

When significant changes or bug fixes were introduced in the current developpement version of the source code, we provide snapshots. 

If available, you can download a <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/download.html#snapshot">recent snapshot</a> following the link. 

\subsection install_win81_msvc_get_source_svn Getting the source from Subversion

You can also get the cutting-edge ViSP version from Subversion repository svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/visp/trunk/ViSP. 

One way to do that under Windows is to install Subversion that comes with Cygwin installer that is available on https://cygwin.com/install.html

- From the previous link, download Cygwin installer for 32-bits or 64-bits version.
- Double click on the setup binary to start installation. Keep the default settings and select a mirror.
- As shown in the next image, in the window that allows to select the packages, search for "subversion" and select "subversion" package in "Devel":
\image html img-win8.1-cygwin-svn.jpg
- Click on Next button twice to start installation, and then on Finish button to exit installer. 
- Now you should be able to use subversion
\code
C:\Users\...> C:\cygwin64\bin\svn.exe --version
svn, version 1.7.14
\endcode

Once installed, to get ViSP source code run:
\code
C:\Users\...> cd C:\ViSP
C:\Users\...> C:\cygwin64\bin\svn.exe checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/visp/trunk/ViSP ViSP-code
\endcode

\section install_win81_msvc_config Configuring ViSP from source 

We suppose now that ViSP source is in a directory denoted  \<source_dir\>, for example \c C:\\ViSP\\ViSP-2.10.0

The goal of the configuration step is now to use CMake to produce a Visual Studio C++ solution that will be located in \<binary_dir\>, for example \c C:\\ViSP\\ViSP-2.10.0-build.

- Launch CMake (cmake-gui) and complete the \<source_dir\> and \<binary_dir\> locations as in the next image.

\image html img-cmake-win8.1-msvc-launch.jpg 

- Click then on "Configure" button.

\image html img-cmake-win8.1-create-build-folder.jpg 

- Click on "Yes" to create the \c C:\\ViSP\\ViSP-2.10.0-build folder.
- Select then your compiler, for example here Visual Studio Express 2013 Win64, and click on "Finish" button. 

\image html img-cmake-win8.1-msvc-version.jpg 

- This will start CMake configuration. As shown in the next image, only OpenMP 3rd party is automatically detected. 

\image html img-cmake-win8.1-4.jpg 

- As given in the previous image, note also that the installation folder is set to \c C:\\ViSP\\ViSP-2.10.0-build\\install. 
\warning If you want to change the installation forder to \c C:/Program \c Files \c (x86)/ViSP, make sure that you have administrator privileges to write in that folder. 

- Click then on "Configure" button. All the red lines should disappear.
\image html img-cmake-win8.1-6.jpg 
\note The default configuration lead to the creation of a shared library (with \c .dll extension). This is the default configuration that is recommended. If you want to create rather a static library (with \c .lib extension) you have to uncheck the \c BUILD_SHARED_LIBS option to disable DLL creation. 

\subsection install_win81_msvc_3rdparty Optional 3rd party packages

ViSP is interfaced with some 3rd party libraries. The <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/libraries.html">complete list is provided here</a>. 

\subsubsection install_win81_msvc_3rdparty_gdi Windows Software Development Kit

- We recommend to install the "Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for windows 8.1" to get the Graphical Device Interface (GDI) capabilities. The GDi is used in ViSP to display images in a window thanks to vpDisplayGDI class. This SDK can be downloaded from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/bg162891.aspx

- Once installed, return to CMake Gui and click on "Configure" button. As shown in the the next image, GDI should be detected.

\image html img-cmake-win8.1-gdi.jpg 

- Click again on "Configure" button.

\subsubsection install_win81_msvc_3rdparty_opencv OpenCV 3rd party

- We recommend to install OpenCV. From http://opencv.org/downloads.html download the latest OpenCV for Windows version. There is an <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_install/windows_install.html#windows-install-prebuild">OpenCV tutorial: Installation Using the Pre-build Libraries</a> that may help. In our case we install \c OpenCV-2.4.10.exe pre-build SDK in \c C:\\OpenCV. The installer opencv-2.4.10.exe copied all the material in \c C:\\OpenCV\\opencv.

- Now in order that ViSP detects OpenCV you have to set \c OpenCV_DIR environment variable. Start up a command window (in your "Start" menu click on "Run" and type in \c cmd.exe) and enter:
\code
setx OpenCV_DIR C:\OpenCV\opencv\build
\endcode

- Here the directory is where you have the build directory (extracted or built).  Inside this folder you should have a file named \c OpenCVConfig.cmake. 

- Quit and restart CMake (cmake gui). <b>It is important to quit CMake</b> in order to take into account the new \c OpenCV_DIR environment variable. Click "Configure" button. As shown in the next image, a new red line indicating that OpenCV is found should appear.

\image html img-cmake-win8.1-opencv.jpg 

- As shown in the next image, if you enable the advanced view, you can see that we will use OpenCV libraries located in \c C:/OpenCV/opencv/build/x64/vc12/lib folder.
 
\image html img-cmake-win8.1-opencv-advanced.jpg 

- Press "Configure" button again.

\subsection install_win81_msvc_gene Ending the configuration

- To finish the configuration, click on "Generate" button.

\image html img-cmake-win8.1-msvc-generate.jpg 

- Once the generation is done, in \c C:/ViSP/ViSP-2.10.0-build folder you have the Visual Studio \c VISP.sln generated solution file.

\image html img-win8.1-msvc-solution.jpg 

\section install_win81_msvc_build Building ViSP from source

- To build ViSP just double click on \c C:/ViSP/ViSP-2.10.0-build/VISP.sln solution file. This action will open ViSP project in Visual Studio C++. As shown in the next image, by default, Visual Studio position the solution configuration to \c Debug.

\image html img-win8.1-msvc-open.jpg 

- Enter menu "BUILD/Build Solution" to build ViSP.

\image html img-win8.1-msvc-build.jpg 

- At the end of the build process you should have the following indicating that all the build succeeded.

\image html img-win8.1-msvc-build-end.jpg 

- Now to install ViSP, build "INSTALL" project. To this end, apply a left click on "INSTALL" to select the project, then a right click to enter in the "Build" menu.

\image html img-win8.1-msvc-install.jpg 

- At the end of the installation, you should have the following.

\image html img-win8.1-msvc-install-end.jpg

- As shown in the previous image, all the headers but also the generated library are copied in \c C:/ViSP/ViSP-2.10.0-build/install folder.

- This ends ViSP installation with \c Debug configuration.

- We recommend now to do the same with \c Release settings. As shown in the next image, select the \c Release configuration. 

\image html img-win8.1-msvc-release.jpg 

- Now, as previously, build and install ViSP again.

- At the end, in \c C:/ViSP/ViSP-2.10.0-build/install/x64/vc12/bin folder you have two versions of ViSP DLL library; the one suffixed by "d" with debug information, the other one optimized with release compiler options.

\section install_win81_msvc_env_var Setting up PATH variable

If you built static libraries then you are done. Otherwise, if you follow this tutorial step by step you need to add the bin folders path to the systems path. This is because you will use ViSP and OpenCV libraries in form of "Dynamic-link libraries" (also known as DLL). Inside these are stored all the algorithms and information the libraries contains. The operating system will load them only on demand, during runtime. However, to do this he needs to know where they are. The systems \c PATH variable contains a list of folders where DLLs can be found. Add ViSP and OpenCV libraries path to this and the OS will know where to look if he ever needs the libraries. Otherwise, you will need to copy the used DLLs right beside the applications executable file (exe) for the OS to find it.

To modify the PATH var and add the path to ViSP library, open a cmd terminal and run:
\code
C:\Users\...> echo %PATH%
C:\Users\...> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\ViSP\ViSP-2.10.0-build\install\x64\vc12\bin"
\endcode

Then to add the path to OpenCV 3rd party library, close and re-open a cmd-terminal and run:
\code
C:\Users\...> echo %PATH%
C:\Users\...> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\OpenCV\opencv\build\x64\vc12\bin"
\endcode

Then close and re-open a cmd terminal to check if the PATH var was well positioned

\code
C:\Users\...> echo %PATH%
\endcode

\section install_win81_msvc_annex Appendix
\subsection install_win81_msvc_annex_data Installing testing data

Some ViSP examples and tests require data set (images, models). These data set is provided as a compressed zip files. 

- Download ViSP-images-2.10.0.zip from http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/download.html#dataDownloadForExample and uncompress it for example in \c C:/ViSP. 

\image html img-win8.1-visp-images.jpg 

\subsection install_win81_msvc_annex_usage Using testing data
- ViSP examples and tests are able to detect automatically the location of the requested data if you position an environment variable called \c VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH. In our case, this variable should be set to \c C:\\ViSP.
\code
setx VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH C:\ViSP
\endcode

- It is also possible to run the examples and tests without positioning \c VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH by using command line option \c -i \<\c path \c to \c the \c data \c set\>. If you want to run \c \<binary dir\>/example/device/display/Debug/displayGDI.exe, open a command window, enter in the right folder, and run: 
\code
displayGDI.exe -i C:\ViSP
\endcode

\image html img-win8.1-cmd-displayGDI.jpg 

You are now ready to see the next \ref tutorial-getting-started that will show you how to use ViSP as a 3rd party to build your own project.
