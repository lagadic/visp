\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on OSX with Homebrew. These steps have been tested with Mac OS X 10.9.5 Mavericks and with 10.10.3 Yosemite. 

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_osx_brew_required Install prerequisities

First, go to http://brew.sh to install Homebrew.

Next use homebrew to install additional software.

\code
$ brew update
$ brew install cmake
\endcode

You will need to add the next line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile to have Homebrew be at the front of the PATH. 
\code
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
\endcode

In order for the above changes to take effect reopen the terminal or run this command:
\code
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode


\section install_osx_brew_3rdparty Install 3rd parties

ViSP is interfaced with several 3rd party libraries. The <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/software-architecture">complete list is provided here</a>.

\subsection install_osx_brew_3rdparty_recommended Recommended 3rd party

We recommend to install the following packages.

\subsubsection install_osx_brew_opencv OpenCV 3rd party

\code
$ brew install homebrew/science/opencv3
\endcode

You can find OpenCV at:

\code
/usr/local/opt/opencv3
\endcode

Now to indicate to CMake where OpenCV is installed you will need to add the following line in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
\code
export OpenCV_DIR=/usr/local/opt/opencv3/share/OpenCV
\endcode
Note that OpenCV_DIR var gives now the location of OpenCVConfig.cmake file.

In order for the above changes to take effect reopen the terminal or run this command:
\code
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

\subsubsection install_osx_brew_libxml2 libxml2 3rd party

Just run the following instruction:
\code
$ brew install libxml2
\endcode

\subsubsection install_osx_brew_libdc1394 libdc1394 3rd party

Just run the following instruction:
\code
$ brew install libdc1394
\endcode

\subsubsection install_osx_brew_zbar zbar 3rd party

To install the zbar library used in detection module for QR code detection, run:
\code
$ brew install zbar
\endcode

\subsection install_osx_brew_3rdparty_other Other 3rd party

\subsubsection install_osx_brew_gsl GSL 3rd party

If lapack 3rd party is not detected during CMake configuration it may be useful to install the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) to benefit from optimized mathematical capabilities. To this end run the following instruction:
\code
$ brew install gsl
\endcode

\section install_osx_brew_install_visp Install ViSP from source code
\subsection install_osx_brew_get_source Getting ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code:

- You can download the <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download">latest release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using either
\code
tar xvzf visp-x.y.z.tar.gz 
\endcode
or
\code
unzip visp-x.y.z.zip
\endcode

- You can also download a <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download#snapshot">daily snapshot</a>. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using
\code
tar xvzf visp-snapshot-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz
\endcode

- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from <a href="https://github.com/lagadic/visp">GitHub repository</a> repository using the following command
\code
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in a directory denoted  \<source_dir\>, for example \c $HOME/visp

\subsection install_osx_brew_config Configuring ViSP from source

- Create first a directory denoted \<binary_dir\> where you want to build ViSP. This directory will contain generated Makefiles, object files, and output libraries and binaries.
\code
cd $HOME; mkdir visp-build
\endcode

- Enter the \<binary_dir\> and configure the build:
\code
cmake ../visp
\endcode
A more versatile way to configure the build is to use \c ccmake, the CMake GUI:
\code
ccmake ../visp
\endcode
The previous command allows to configure (just by pressing [c] key) the build in a more advanced way where some options could be easily turned On/Off. It allows also to see which are the 3rd party that will be used.
Then to generate the makefiles, just press [g] key in the ccmake gui.
Now we can build ViSP.

\subsection install_osx_brew_build Building ViSP from source

- To build ViSP proceed with:
\code
$ make -j4
\endcode

- To install ViSP proceed with:
\code
$ sudo make install
\endcode

- To build ViSP documentation, you have first to install Doxygen package:
\code
$ brew install doxygen
\endcode
Then you can proceed with:
\code
$ make -j4 visp_doc
\endcode
\section install_brew_dataset Install ViSP dataset
Some ViSP examples and tests require data (images, video, models) that are not part of ViSP source code but available in a separate archive named \c ViSP-images-x.y.z.zip. This archive could be downloaded from http://visp.inria.fr/download page. We provide here after the way to install these data if you want to run ViSP examples.

\code
cd $HOME
unzip ViSP-images-x.y.z.zip
\endcode

We suppose now that the data are located in \c $HOME/ViSP-images.
\code
$ ls $HOME/ViSP-images
Klimt	     README.md    circle  ellipse    iv    mbt   mire-2
LICENSE.txt  calibration  cube    ellipse-1  line  mire  video
\endcode

Set \c VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH environment variable to help ViSP examples and tests to find the location of the data set. It's convenient if the environment variables is automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched: 

\code
echo "export VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH=$HOME" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

\note For historical reasons \c VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH should not contain the folder \c ViSP-images, but the parent folder.

From now, you can try to run ViSP examples and tests. For example you can run \c displayX example that should open a windows with Klimt painting image and some overlay drawings:

\code
$ cd $HOME/visp-build
$ ./example/device/display/displayX

A click to close the windows...

A click to display a cross...
Cross position: 201, 441

A click to exit the program...
Bye
\endcode

\section install_brew_tips Tips and tricks

\subsection install_brew_tips_uninstall How to uninstall ViSP
After ViSP installation, you can remove installed material using:
\code
$ sudo make uninstall
\endcode

\subsection install_brew_tips_modules How to build only ViSP libraries

If you want to build only ViSP modules libraries, nor the examples, tutorials and tests:
\code
$ make -j4 visp_modules
\endcode

\subsection install_brew_tips_module_once How to build a ViSP specific module

If you want to build a given module and all the dependencies:
\code
$ make -j4 visp_<module_name>
\endcode
For example to build the model-based tracker module named mbt, run:
\code
$ make -j4 visp_mbt
\endcode

\subsection install_brew_tips_target Which are the targets that could be run with make ?

To know which are the target available with \c make:
\code
$ make help | grep visp
... visp_tests
... visp_demos
... visp_tutorials
... visp_examples
... visp_modules
... visp_doc
... visp_core
... visp_detection

\endcode

\subsection install_brew_tips_3rd_party Which are the 3rd party libraries that are used in ViSP ?

To see which are the optional 3rd parties that are found during the configuration stage and that will be used by ViSP during the build you can have a look to the text file named \c ViSP-third-party.txt and located in \<binary_dir\>. We provide hereafter an example of a possible content of this file:

\section install_osx_brew_issues Kwown issues
\subsection install_osx_brew_issues_opencv3 /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig is not writable

- During OpenCV installation, if you get the following errors:
\code
$ brew install opencv3
Could not symlink lib/pkgconfig/isl.pc
/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig is not writable.

You can try again using:
  brew link isl
...
\endcode
it means maybe that you install other softwares without brew in /usr/local.
A work arround is to change the owner of the corresponding folder like:
\code
$ sudo chown {your-user-name} /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
\endcode

- If you enter into troubles with the packages you install with brew, a good stating is to run:
\code
$ brew doctor
\endcode

\subsection install_osx_brew_issues_libpng Application built with libpng-1.5.18 but running with 1.6.17
- If you encounter the following issue
\code
$ ./modules/vision/testKeypoint-5
libpng warning: Application built with libpng-1.5.18 but running with 1.6.17
error: can't create a png read structure!
error reading png file
\endcode
It means that apparently there is a conflict between libpng version installed by "brew install opencv3" (1.6.17), and the one used by X11/XQuartz (1.5.18).
A work arround is to turn off libpng usage in ViSP. To configure and build again ViSP without png support:
\code
$ ccmake -DUSE_PNG=OFF ../ViSP
$ make -j4
\endcode
An other work arround option is to turn off X11 usage in ViSP. Display capabilities will be then the one from OpenCV. To this end, configure and build again ViSP without X11 support:
\code
$ ccmake -DUSE_X11=OFF ../ViSP
$ make -j4
\endcode
