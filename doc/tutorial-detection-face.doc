\section intro_face Introduction

This tutorial shows how to detect one or more faces with ViSP. Face detection is performed using OpenCV Haar cascade capabilities that are used in vpDetectorFace class. At least OpenCV 2.2.0 or a more recent version is requested.

In the next sections you will find examples that show how to detect faces in a video, or in images acquired by a camera connected to your computer.

\section face_detection_video Face detection in a video

The following example also available in tutorial-face-detector.cpp allows to detect faces in an mpeg video located near the source code. The Haar cascade classifier file requested by OpenCV is also provided in the same folder as the source code.

\include tutorial-face-detector.cpp

To detect the faces just run:
\code
$ ./tutorial-face-detector
\endcode
You will get the following result:

\endhtmlonly

Now we explain the main lines of the source.

First we have to include the header of the class that allows to detect a face.
\snippet tutorial-face-detector.cpp Include

Then in the main() function before going further we need to check if OpenCV 2.2.0 is available. 

\snippet tutorial-face-detector.cpp Macro defined

We set then the default input data:
- the name of the Haar cascade classifier file "haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml"
- the name of the input video "video.mpeg"

\snippet tutorial-face-detector.cpp Default settings

With command line options it is possible to use other inputs. To know how just run:

\code
$ ./tutorial-face-detector --help
Usage: ./tutorial-face-detector [--haar <haarcascade xml filename>] [--video <input video file>] [--help]
\endcode

Then we open the video stream, create a windows named "ViSP viewer" where images and the resulting face detection will be displayed.
  
The creation of the face detector is performed using

\snippet tutorial-face-detector.cpp Face detector construction
 
We need also to set the location and name of the xml file that contains the Haar cascade classifier data used to recognized a face.

\snippet tutorial-face-detector.cpp Face detector setting

Then we enter in the while loop where for each new image, the try to detect one or more faces:

\snippet tutorial-face-detector.cpp Face detection

If a face is detected, vpDetectorFace::detect() returns true. It is then possible to retrieve the number of faces that are detected:

\snippet tutorial-face-detector.cpp Get number faces

For each face, we have access to its location using vpDetectorFace::getPolygon(), its bounding box using vpDetectorFace::getBBox() and its identifier message using vpDetectorFace::getMessage().

\snippet tutorial-face-detector.cpp Get face characteristics

\note When more than one face is detected, faces are ordered from the largest to the smallest. That means that vpDetectorFace::getPolygon(0), vpDetectorFace::getBBox(0) and vpDetectorFace::getMessage(0) return always the characteristics of the largest face.

\section face_detection_live Face detection from a camera

This other example also available in tutorial-face-detector-live.cpp shows how to detect one or more faces in images acquired by a camera connected to your computer.

\include tutorial-face-detector-live.cpp

The usage of this example is similar to the previous one. Just run 
\code
$ ./tutorial-face-detector-live
\endcode

Additional command line options are available to specify the location of the Haar cascade file and also the camera identifier if more than one camera is connected to your computer:

\code
$ ./tutorial-face-detector-live --help
Usage: ./tutorial-face-detector-live [--device <camera device>] [--haar <haarcascade xml filename>] [--help]
\endcode

The source code of this example is very similar to the previous one except that here we use camera framegrabber devices (see \ref tutorial-grabber). Two different grabber may be used:
- If ViSP was build with Video For Linux (V4L2) support available for example on Fedora or Ubuntu distribution, VISP_HAVE_V4L2 macro is defined. In that case, images coming from an USB camera are acquired using vpV4l2Grabber class. 
- If ViSP wasn't build with V4L2 support, but with OpenCV we use cv::VideoCapture class to grab the images. Notice that when images are acquired with OpenCV there is an additional conversion from cv::Mat to vpImage.

\snippet tutorial-face-detector-live.cpp Construct grabber

Then in the while loop, at each iteration we acquire a new image
\snippet tutorial-face-detector-live.cpp Acquisition

This new image is then given as input to the face detector.
