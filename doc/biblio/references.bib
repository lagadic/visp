  abstract =	 {Our work is concerned with robotics and vision, and
                  more precisely visual servoing. It consists in the
                  design of methods that do not need the model of the
                  observed objects or a precise calibration of the
                  system. First, the problem of the Euclidean
                  reconstruction (up to a scale factor), from two
                  images of a unknown static object, has been
                  studied. It has been highlighted that the best
                  linear solution for a robust reconstruction of the
                  camera displacement is to use an homography
                  matrix. Thus, an algorithm for the linear estimation
                  of this matrix has been proposed. Then, two new
                  visual servoing schemes, based on the partial
                  Euclidean reconstruction, are proposed. The
                  closed-loop system is analyzed in order to obtain
                  the robustness domain of a proportional control law
                  with respect to the system calibration
                  errors. Later, it has been shown that, thanks to the
                  decoupled structure of the considered systems, it is
                  possible to considerably increase the robustness
                  domain with an adaptive control law. The new methods
                  have been tested on a Cartesian robot and on a
                  redundant robot, and then compared to the classic
                  ones. The obtained results confirm the improvement
                  in the stability of our methods. Finally, the visual
                  servoing techniques have been extended to the use of
                  several cameras observing different parts of the
                  scene. The multi-camera visual servoing has been
                  designed as a part of the task function
                  approach. The particular choice of the task function
                  allows us to simplify the design of the control law
                  and the stability analysis. In the end, a
                  positioning task of a cumbersome object has been
                  realized using two cameras mounted on a manipulator
                  robot.},

  abstract =	 { Tracking is a very important research subject in a
                  real-time augmented reality context. The main
                  requirements for trackers are high accuracy and
                  little latency at a reasonable cost. In order to
                  address these issues, a real-time, robust and
                  efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is
                  proposed for a 'video see through' monocular vision
                  system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts
                  to calculating the pose between the camera and the
                  objects.  Virtual objects can then be projected into
                  the scene using the pose. Here, non-linear pose
                  estimation is formulated by means of a virtual
                  visual servoing approach. In this context, the
                  derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices
                  are given for different 3D geometrical primitives
                  including straight lines, circles, cylinders and
                  spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in
                  order to provide real-time tracking of points normal
                  to the object contours.  Robustness is obtained by
                  integrating a M-estimator into the visual control
                  law via an iteratively re-weighted least squares
                  implementation. This approach is then extended to
                  address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem.
                  The method presented in this paper has been
                  validated on several complex image sequences
                  including outdoor environments.  Results show the
                  method to be robust to occlusion, changes in
                  illumination and miss-tracking.}

  abstract = { This paper proposes a real-time, robust and effective tracking framework for visual servoing applications. The algorithm is based on the fusion of visual cues and on the estimation of a transformation (either a homography or a 3D pose). The parameters of this transformation are estimated using a non-linear minimization of a unique criterion that integrates information both on the texture and the edges of the tracked object. The proposed tracker is more robust and performs well in conditions where methods based on a single cue fail. The framework has been tested for 2D object motion estimation and pose computation. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several video sequences as well as in visual servoing experiments considering various objects. Results show the method to be robust to occlusions or textured backgrounds and suitable for visual servoing applications. }
