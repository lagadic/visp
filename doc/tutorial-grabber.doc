  \section grabber-camera-firewire-unix Images from firewire cameras


The next example shows how to use a framegrabber to acquire color images from a firewire camera under Unix. The following example suppose that libX11 and libdc1394-2 3rd party are available.

\include tutorial-grabber-1394.cpp

Here after we explain the new lines that are introduced.

First an instance of the frame grabber is created. During the creating a bus reset is send. If you don't want to reset the firewire bus, just turn reset to false.
\code
   vp1394TwoGrabber g(reset);
\endcode

Once the grabber is created, we set the camera image size, color coding, and framerate. 
\code
  g.setVideoMode(vp1394TwoGrabber::vpVIDEO_MODE_640x480_MONO8);
  g.setFramerate(vp1394TwoGrabber::vpFRAMERATE_60);
\endcode

Note that here you can specify some other settings such as the firewire transmission speed. For a more complete list of settings see vp1394TwoGrabber class. 
\code
  g.setIsoTransmissionSpeed(vp1394TwoGrabber::vpISO_SPEED_800);
\endcode

Then the grabber is initialized using:
\code
  g.open(I);
\endcode
From now the color image \c I is also initialized with the size corresponding to the grabber settings. 


Then we enter in a while loop where image acquisition is simply done by:

\code
  g.acquire(I);
\endcode

We are waiting for a non blocking mouse event to break the while loop before ending the program.
\code
  if (vpDisplay::getClick(I, false)) break;
\endcode

In the previous example we use vp1394TwoGrabber class that works for firewire cameras under Unix. If you are under Windows, you may use vp1394CMUGrabber class. A similar example is provided in tutorial-grabber-CMU1394.cpp. 


\section grabber-camera-other Images from other cameras


If you want to grab images from an usb camera under Unix, you may use vpV4l2Grabber class. To this end libv4l should be installed. An example is provided in tutorial-grabber-v4l2.cpp. 

It is also possible to grab images using OpenCV. You may find examples in tutorial-grabber-opencv.cpp and tutorial-grabber-opencv-bis.cpp.

\section grabber-video-stream Images from a video stream

With ViSP it also possible to get images from an input video stream. Supported formats are *.avi, *.mp4, *.mov, *.ogv, *.flv and many others... To this end we exploit ffmpeg or OpenCV 3rd parties.

If ViSP was build with ffmpeg 3rd party support (cmake -DUSE_FFMPEG=ON ...), we use ffmpeg capabilities to decode the video stream. If ffmpeg is not found or used (cmake -DUSE_FFMPEG=OFF ...) and if OpenCV is available (cmake -DUSE_OPENCV=ON ...) we use rather OpenCV capabilities. This new feature was introduced in ViSP 2.10.0 and is especially useful under Windows where installing ffmpeg is quite complex. 

The example below available in tutorial-video-reader.cpp shows how o consider an mpeg video stream.

\warning We recall that this example works only if ViSP was build with ffmpeg or OpenCV support.

\include tutorial-video-reader.cpp

We explain now the new lines that were introduced.

\code
#include <visp/vpTime.h>
#include <visp/vpVideoReader.h>
\endcode
Include the header of the vpTime class that allows to measure time, and of the vpVideoReader class that allows to read a video stream.

\code
  vpVideoReader g;
\endcode
Create an instance of a video reader.

\code
  g.setFileName("./video.mpg");
\endcode
Set the name of the video stream. Here \c video.mpg refers to a mpeg file located in the same folder than the executable.

The vpVideoReader class can also handle a sequence of images. For example, to read the following images:

\code
% ls *.png
image0000.png
image0001.png
image0002.png
image0003.png
image0004.png
...
\endcode

you may use the following

\code
  g.setFileName("./image%04d.png");
\endcode
where you specify that each image number is coded with 4 digits. Here, ffmpeg is no yet mandatory, but rather \c libpng or OpenCV that should be available to read PNG images. Supported image formats are PPM, PGM, PNG and JPEG. 

Then as for any other grabber, you have to initialize the frame grabber using:

\code
  g.open(I);
\endcode

Then we enter in the while loop until the last image was not reached:
\code
  while (! g.end() ) {  
\endcode

To get the next image in the stream, we just use:

\code
  g.acquire(I);
\endcode

To synchronize the video decoding with the video framerate, we measure the beginning time of each loop iteration:

\code
  double t = vpTime::measureTimeMs();
\endcode

The synchronization is done by waiting from the beginning of the iteration the corresponding time expressed in milliseconds by using:
\code
  vpTime::wait(t, 1000. / g.getFramerate());
\endcode

You are now ready to see the next \ref tutorial-tracking-blob.
