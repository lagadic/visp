\page tutorial-install-win10-msvc12 Tutorial: Installation from source for Windows with Visual C++ 2013 (vc12)
\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on Windows 8.1 or 10.0 with Visual C++ 2013. These steps have been tested on Windows 10.0 (64 bit), with CMake 3.9.6 and Visual Studio Express 2013. 

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_win10_msvc12_required Install prerequisities

- Visual Studio C++. Note that ViSP can also be build with Visual Studio Express that could be downloaded from  http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products. In this tutorial we use Visual Studio Express 2013. 
\note If you want to use Visual Studio Express, you have to install <b>Express 2013 for Windows Desktop</b>. The \b Desktop version is important to work with CMake.
- CMake that could be download at : http://www.cmake.org. Download the latest release for Windows win64-x64 platform (at the time this tuto was written it was the file \c cmake-3.9.6-win64-x64.msi). To install just double click on the msi file.

\section install_win10_msvc12_ws Create a workspace

First create a workspace that will contain all ViSP and optional 3rd parties. This workspace is here set to \c C:\\workspace folder, but it could be set to any other location.
To create the workspace:
- Open a \c cmd terminal (in your "Start" menu click on "Run" and type in \c cmd.exe) and run:
\code
C:\> mkdir C:\workspace
\endcode

\section install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty Install 3rd parties

ViSP is interfaced with several 3rd party libraries. The <a href="https://visp.inria.fr/software-architecture">complete list is provided here</a>. If you are with Windows 8.1 we recommend to install \ref install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_gdi. We recommend also to install \ref install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_opencv. Other 3rd parties like \ref install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_ogre are optional and should be considered only by expert developers.


\subsection install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_gdi Windows SDK 3rd party

If you are under Windows 8.1 we recommend to install the "Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for windows 8.1" to get the Graphical Device Interface (GDI) capabilities. The GDI is used in ViSP to display images in a window thanks to vpDisplayGDI class.

- This SDK can be downloaded from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/bg162891.aspx

\subsection install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_opencv OpenCV 3rd party

<b>1. Get OpenCV</b>

First you have to get OpenCV:
- From http://opencv.org/releases.html download OpenCV 3.0.0 for Windows. In our case we got \c opencv-3.0.0.exe Win pack installer.
- Extract the content of the archive in `C:\workspace`.
\image html img-win10-extract-opencv.png
- The installer extracted all the material in `C:\workspace\opencv`.
\note OpenCV 3.0.0 windows installer contains pre-build libraries compatible with Visual C++ 2013 (vc12) in `C:\workspace\opencv\build\x64\vc12` and also libraries compatible with Visual C++ 2012 (vc11) in `C:\workspace\opencv\build\x64\vc11`. With a more recent OpenCV release you need to build yourself OpenCV from source with Visual C++ 2013 (vc12) as it is done in \ref tutorial-install-win10-msvc15.
- We strongly recommend to rename this folder to a name that contain OpenCV version like `C:\workspace\opencv-3.0.0`.

<b>2. Complete OpenCV installation</b>

Now you have to complete OpenCV installation setting some environment vars:
- In order that ViSP detects OpenCV you have to set `OpenCV_DIR` environment variable. Start up a \c cmd terminal and enter:
\code
C:\> setx OpenCV_DIR "C:\workspace\opencv-3.0.0\build"
\endcode
where `C:\workspace\opencv-3.0.0\build` is where you have installed OpenCV. Inside this folder you should have a file named \c OpenCVConfig.cmake. 

- You have also to add the location of OpenCV libraries in the PATH environment variable following the indications mentioned in \ref install_win10_msvc12_env_var.

\subsection install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_realsense2 librealsense 2.x 3rd party

In order to use vpRealSense2 class, see instructions provided in \ref install_win10_msvc14_3rdparty_realsense2 installation and adapt the build folder to `build-vc12`.

\subsection install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_realsense librealsense 1.12.1 3rd party

\note We recommend rather to install \ref install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_realsense2 to have an up-to-date Realsense SDK.

The following instructions are provided to install the old Realsense 1.12.1 SDK compatible with F200, R200, LR200, ZR300 cameras in order to use vpRealSense class. If you have already installed \ref install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_realsense2 you may skip this section.

<b>1. Get librealsense 1.12.1</b>

- Get librealsense 1.12.1 source code from github

        C:\> cd C:\workspace
        C:\> git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense.git librealsense-1.12.1
        C:\> cd librealsense-1.12.1
        C:\> git checkout tags/v1.12.1
    
- Here we suppose that you have librealsense source code in `C:\workspace\librealsense-1.12.1` folder.

<b>2. Configure librealsense 1.12.1</b>

- Launch CMake (cmake-gui), complete the source code and build locations as in the next image to set the location of the build to `C:/workspace/librealsense-1.12.1/build-vc12`:
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc12-realsense-config.png
- Click then on "Configure" button and accept the creation of the build directory by a click on "Yes" button. 
- Select then your compiler "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" and click on "Finish" button. 
- Modify `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` var to `C:/workspace/librealsense-1.12.1/build-vc12` folder location.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc12-realsense-install.png
- Click again on "Configure" button. All the red lines should disappear.
- To finish the configuration, click on "Generate" button.

<b>3. Install librealsense 1.12.1</b>

- To build librealsense just double click on `C:/workspace/librealsense-1.12.1/build-vc12/Realsense.sln` solution file. This action will open Realsense project in Visual Studio C++ 12 2013.
- Select `Release` configuration and build `INSTALL` target
\image html img-win10-msvc12-realsense-build.png
- After these steps, librealsense library could be found in `C:/workspace/librealsense-1.12.1/build-vc12/bin/realsense.dll`

<b>4. Complete librealsense 1.12.1 installation</b>

- Set `REALSENSE_DIR` environment variable:
\code
C:\> setx REALSENSE_DIR "C:\workspace\librealsense-1.12.1\build-vc12"
\endcode
- You have also to add the location of librealsense library in the PATH environment variable following the indications mentioned in \ref install_win10_msvc12_env_var.

\subsection install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_ogre Ogre3D 3rd party

\warning Ogre3D installation from source code described in this section is reserved to expert users. 

If you are interested in augmented reality (see vpAROgre), or if you want to enable advanced visibility computation during model-based tracking (see vpMbTracker::setOgreVisibilityTest() and \ref tutorial-tracking-mb) we recommend to install Ogre3D. You can check if a <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/download/sdk">prebuild SDK</A> matches your Visual C++ version, and follow the <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/Installing+the+Ogre+SDK">SDK installation instructions</a>. You can also install the lastest release from source. Based on our experience, this is what we recommend. 

Ogre source code is hosted on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre">BitBucket</a>. On Ogre wiki you will find useful information to <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=Building+Ogre">build and install Ogre from source</a>. Hereafter we give the main steps.

<b>1. Get Ogre prerequisities</b>
- To build Ogre on Windows you will need to install the DirectX SDK. Since Windows 8, DirectX is no longer a standalone package, rather it is bundled in the Windows 8.x SDK. The latest version is the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/bg162891.aspx">Windows 8.1 SDK</a>.
- To get the Ogre source code but also the source code of all the dependencies hosted on BitBucket and available with Mercurial, you have to install <a href="http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org">TortoiseHg</a>. 

<b>2. Get Ogre dependencies</b>
- A repository containing Ogre dependencies source code is available <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cabalistic/ogredeps">here at BitBucket</a>.
- Open an explorer window, and enter in TortoiseHg Clone menu. Select as source https://bitbucket.org/cabalistic/ogredeps and as destination \c C:\\Ogre\\ogredeps as in the next image:
\image html img-win10-ogredeps-tortoisehg.png
- Click on "Clone" button to get dependencies source code in `C:\workspace\ogredeps`

<b>3. Build Ogre dependencies</b>
- To build the dependencies, open CMake GUI and set source code location pointing to `C:\workspace\ogredeps` and build location pointing to `C:\workspace\ogredeps\build-vc12`. Select Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64 as generator, click on "Configure" button twice and then on "Generate" button. You should have something similar to the next image:
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc12-ogredeps.png
- Open `C:\workspace\ogredeps\build-vc12\OGREDEPS.sln` solution file with Visual C++. 
- In Visual, select Debug configuration and build INSTALL project:
\image html img-win10-msvc12-build-ogredeps.png
\note If the build fails due to the environment variable \c DXSDK_DIR that is not set, see \ref known_issues_win10_msvc12_ogredeps for a work arround.
- In Visual, select also Release configuration and build again INSTALL project.
\image html img-win10-msvc12-build-ogredeps-install-release.png
- Now in `C:\workspace\ogredeps\build-vc12\ogredeps\bin` you will find the `cg.dll` and `OIS.dll` dependencies build in Debug and Release:
- To finish dependencies installation, set \c OGRE_DEPENDENCIES_DIR environment variable pointing to `C:\workspace\ogredeps\build-vc12\ogredeps`
\code
C:\> setx OGRE_DEPENDENCIES_DIR C:\workspace\ogredeps\build-vc12\ogredeps
\endcode

<b>4. Get Ogre source</b>

- From <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/download/source">Ogre download page</a>, identify the last release. In our case Ogre 1.10.9 that is on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre/branches">BitBucket repository</a> under branch v1-10-9.
- Open an explorer window, and enter in TortoiseHg Clone menu. Select as source https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre, as destination `C:\workspace\ogre` and select revision v1-10-9 corresponding to the branch of the latest release as presented in the next image:
\image html img-win10-ogre-tortoisehg.png
- Click on "Clone" button to get Ogre source code in `C:\workspace\ogre`

<b>5. Build Ogre source</b>

- Close and re-open CMake Gui. Set source code location pointing to `C:\workspace\ogre` and build location pointing to `C:\workspace\ogre\build-vc12`. Select "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" as generator, click on "Configure" button and then on "Generate" button. You should have something similar to the next image:
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc12-ogre.png
\note As shown in the previous image, Ogre installation folder is set to `C:\workspace\ogre\build-vc12\sdk`.
- Open `C:\workspace\ogre\build-vc12\OGRE.sln` solution file with Visual C++. 
- In Visual, select Debug configuration and build INSTALL project.
- In Visual, select also Release configuration and build again INSTALL project.
\image html img-win10-msvc12-build-ogre-install-release.png
- Now in `C:\workspace\ogre\build-vc12\sdk\bin` you will find all the libraries in Debug and Release configuration, including cg and OIS dependencies that were build previously.
\image html img-win10-ogre-explorer.png

<b>6. Complete Ogre installation</b>

- To finish Ogre installation set `OGRE_DIR` environment variables to `C:\workspace\ogre\build-vc12\sdk` location.
\code
C:\> setx OGRE_DIR C:\workspace\ogre\build-vc12\sdk
\endcode

\section install_win10_msvc12_install_visp Install ViSP from source code
\subsection install_win10_msvc12_get_source Getting ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code.

- You can download the <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download">latest release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once visp-x.y.z.tar.gz or visp-x.y.z.zip is downloaded, uncompress the file in `C:\workspace\visp\visp-x.y.z` using for axample <a href="http://www.win-rar.com">WinRAR</a>.

- You can also download a <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download#snapshot">daily snapshot</a>. Once visp-snapshot-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz is downloaded, uncompress the file in `C:\workspace\visp\visp-x.y.z` using for axample <a href="http://www.win-rar.com">WinRAR</a>.

- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from <a href="https://github.com/lagadic/visp">GitHub repository</a> using the git command line (see \ref install_win7_tip_git):
\code
C:\> mkdir C:\workspace\visp
C:\> cd C:\workspace\visp
C:\> git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in `C:\workspace\visp\visp`. 

\subsection install_win10_msvc12_config Configuring ViSP from source 

The goal of the configuration step is now to use CMake to produce a Visual Studio C++ solution file that will be located in `C:/workspace/visp/visp-build-vc12`.

- Launch CMake (cmake-gui) and complete the source code and binaries location as in the next image.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc12-visp-launch.png
- Click then on "Configure" button.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc12-visp-create-folder.png
- Click on "Yes" to create the `C:/workspace/visp/visp-build-vc12` folder.
- Select then your compiler "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" and click on "Finish" button.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc12-msvc-version.png
- This will start CMake configuration. As shown in the next image, eigen, Flycapture, GDI (Graphical Device Interface), OpenCV,  OpenMP, Pylon, Realsense, XML2 and zbar 3rd parties are automatically detected. 
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc12-visp-config.png
\note Installation folder is set to `C:/workspace/visp/visp-build-vc12/install`. If you want to change the installation folder to `C:/Program Files (x86)/ViSP`, make sure that you have administrator privileges to write in that folder before modifying `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. 

- Click then on "Configure" button. All the red lines should disappear.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc12-visp-config2.png
\note The default configuration lead to the creation of a shared library (with \c .dll extension). This is the default configuration that is recommended. If you want to create rather a static library (with \c .lib extension) you have to uncheck the \c BUILD_SHARED_LIBS option to disable DLL creation. 

- To finish the configuration, click on "Generate" button.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc12-visp-generate.png

- Once the generation is done, in `C:/workspace/visp/visp-build-vc12` folder you have the Visual Studio \c VISP.sln generated solution file.


\subsection install_win10_msvc12_build Building ViSP from source

- To build ViSP just double click on `C:/workspace/visp/visp-build-vc12/VISP.sln` solution file. This action will open ViSP project in Visual Studio C++. As shown in the next image, by default, Visual Studio position the solution configuration to \c Debug.
\image html img-win10-msvc12-visp-open.png

- Enter menu "BUILD/Build Solution" to build ViSP or hit "Ctrl+Shift+B".

- At the end of the build process you should have the following indicating that all the build succeeded.
\image html img-win10-msvc12-visp-build-end.png

- Now to install ViSP, build "INSTALL" project. To this end, apply a left click on "INSTALL" to select the project, then a right click to enter in the "Build" menu.
\image html img-win10-msvc12-visp-install.png

- At the end of the installation, you should have the following.
\image html img-win10-msvc12-visp-install-end.png

- As shown in the previous image, all the headers but also the generated libraries are copied in `C:/workspace/visp/visp-build-vc12/install` folder; headers and libraries in `include` and `x64/vc14` subfolders respectively.

- This ends ViSP installation with \c Debug configuration.

- We recommend now to do the same with \c Release settings. As shown in the next image, select the \c Release configuration. 
\image html img-win10-msvc12-visp-release.png

- Now, as previously, build and install ViSP again.

- At the end, in `C:/workspace/visp/visp-build-vc12/install/x64/vc12/bin` folder you have two versions of ViSP DLL libraries corresponding to ViSP modules; the one suffixed by "d" with debug information, the other one optimized with release compiler options.
\image html img-win10-msvc12-visp-explorer-install.png



\subsection install_win10_msvc12_env_var Setting up PATH variable

If you built static libraries then you are done. Otherwise, if you follow this tutorial step by step you need to add the bin folders path to the systems path. This is because you will use ViSP and OpenCV libraries in form of "Dynamic-link libraries" (also known as DLL). Inside these are stored all the algorithms and information the libraries contains. The operating system will load them only on demand, during runtime. However, to do this he needs to know where they are. The systems \c PATH variable contains a list of folders where DLLs can be found. Add ViSP and OpenCV libraries path to this and the OS will know where to look if he ever needs the libraries. Otherwise, you will need to copy the used DLLs right beside the applications executable file (exe) for the OS to find it.

To modify the PATH var and add the path to ViSP library, open a cmd terminal and run:
\code
C:\> echo %PATH%
C:\> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\workspace\visp\visp-build-vc12\install\x64\vc12\bin"
\endcode

Then to add the path to OpenCV 3rd party libraries location, close and re-open a cmd-terminal and run:
\code
C:\> echo %PATH%
C:\> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\workspace\opencv-3.0.0\build\x64\vc12\bin"
\endcode

Then to add the path to librealsense 3rd party library location, close and re-open a cmd-terminal and run:
\code
C:\> echo %PATH%
C:\> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\workspace\librealsense-2\build-vc12\bin"
\endcode
\note If you rather install librealsense 1.12.1 use rather:
\code
C:\> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\workspace\librealsense-1.12.1\build-vc12\bin"
\endcode

If installed, you have also to add the location of Ogre 3rd party libraries to the path. Close and re-open a cmd terminal to run:
\code
C:\> echo %PATH%
C:\> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\workspace\ogre\build-vc12\sdk\bin"
C:\> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\workspace\ogre\build-vc12\sdk\bin\Release"
C:\> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\workspace\ogre\build-vc12\sdk\bin\Debug"
\endcode

Then close and re-open a cmd terminal to check if the PATH var was well positioned.

\code
C:\> echo %PATH%
\endcode

\section install_win10_msvc12_dataset Install ViSP dataset

Some ViSP examples and tests require data (images, video, models) that are not part of ViSP source code but available in a separate archive named `visp-images-x.y.z.zip`. This archive could be downloaded from https://visp.inria.fr/download page. We provide here after the way to install these data if you want to run ViSP examples.

Download `visp-images-3.1.0.zip` from https://visp.inria.fr/download and uncompress it in your workspace `C:/workspace`. 
\image html img-win10-visp-images.png

ViSP examples and tests are able to detect automatically the location of the requested data if you position an environment variable called `VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH`. In our case, this variable should be set to `C:\workspace\visp-images-3.1.0`.
\code
C:\> setx VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH C:\workspace\visp-images-3.1.0
\endcode

From now, you can try to run ViSP examples and tests. For example, if you want to run `C:/workspace/visp/visp-build-vc12/example/device/display/Debug/displayGDI.exe`, open a command window, enter in the right folder, and run:

\image html img-win8.1-cmd-displayGDI.jpg 

\section known_issues_win10_msvc12 Known issues

\subsection known_issues_win10_msvc12_ogredeps Unable to build ogredeps: DXSDK_DIR missing

During ogredeps build as described in \ref install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_ogre installation you may get in Visual C++ the following error when building SDL2 project:
\code
error: DIRECTX requires $DXSDK_DIR environment variable to be set
\endcode
\image html img-win8.1-msvc-ogredeps-issue.jpg

To fix the issue:
- Quit Visual C++ and start again CMake over ogredeps project
- Disable SDL2 dependency build turning \c OGREDEPS_BUILD_SDL2 option off 
\image html img-win8.1-cmake-ogredeps-issue.jpg
- Configure and generate again the project
- Open \c C:\\Ogre\\ogredeps\\build\\OGREDEPS.sln solution file with Visual C++ and try a new build as described in \ref install_win10_msvc12_3rdparty_ogre 

\subsection known_issues_win10_msvc12_ogre_mbtracker Model-based trackers are not working with Ogre visibility ckeck

If you run \c mbtEdgeTracking.exe, \c mbtKltTracking.exe or \c mbtEdgeKltTracking.exe enabling Ogre visibility check (using "-o" option), you may encounter the following issue:
\code
C:\ViSP\visp-build\example\Tracking\Debug> mbtEdgeTracking.exe -c -o
...
OGRE EXCEPTION(6:FileNotFoundException): Cannot locate resource VTFInstancing.cg in resource group General
...
*** Initializing OIS ***
\endcode
and then a wonderful runtime issue as in the next image:
\image html img-win8.1-msvc-mbtracker-ogre-issue.jpg

It means maybe that Ogre version is not compatible with DirectX 11. This can be checked adding "-w" option to the command line:
\code
C:\ViSP\visp-build\example\Tracking\Debug> mbtEdgeTracking.exe -c -o -w
\endcode
Now the binary should open the Ogre configuration window where you have to select "OpenGL Rendering Subsystem" instead of "Direct3D11 Rendering Subsystem". Press then OK to continue and start the tracking of the cube.
\image html img-win8.1-msvc-mbtracker-ogre-opengl.jpg
