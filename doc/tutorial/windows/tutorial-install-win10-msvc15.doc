\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on Windows 10 with Visual C++. These steps have been tested on Windows 10 (64 bit), with CMake 3.13.1 and Visual Studio Community 2017. 

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_win10_msvc15_required Install prerequisites

\subsection install_win10_msvc15_3rd_msvc Visual Studio

Visual Studio Community 2017 could be downloaded from https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/. During a fresh installation enable "Desktop development with C++" workload to get "Windows 10 SDK". This SDK allows usage of the Graphical Device Interface (GDI) useful to display images in a window thanks to vpDisplayGDI class. After a fresh installation, start Visual Studio and create an empty C++ project to install the common tools for Visual C++ 2017.

If you already have Visual Studio Community 2017, you can check if "Desktop Development with C++" workload is activated and if "Windows 10 SDK" is enabled following instructions given <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/modify-visual-studio?view=vs-2017">here</a> that we resume:

1. Find the Visual Studio Installer on your computer.
Select Start, and then scroll to the letter V, where it's listed as Visual Studio Installer
2. Click or tap to start the installer, and then choose "Modify"
3. From the Workloads screen, check if "Desktop Development with C++" workload is activated and if "Windows 10 SDK" is enabled like in the following image
\image html img-msvc15-config.png
4. Choose Modify again.
5. After the new workloads and components are installed, choose Launch.

\subsection install_win10_msvc15_3rd_cmake CMake

CMake could be download from http://www.cmake.org. Download the latest release for Windows win64-x64 platform (at the time this tuto was written it was the file `cmake-3.13.1-win64-x64.msi`). To install just double click on the msi file.

\subsection install_win10_msvc15_3rd_git Git

Install Git for Windows from https://git-for-windows.github.io/. This installation allows then to use git in a `cmd` Command Prompt.

\section install_win10_msvc15_ws Create a workspace

If not already done, create a workspace that will contain all ViSP source, build, data set and optional 3rd parties. This workspace is here set to `C:\visp-ws` folder, but it could be set to any other location.

To create the workspace, open a `cmd` Command Prompt (a fast way to launch this window is to press the Win + R keys on your keyboard. Then, type `cmd` or `cmd.exe` and press Enter or click/tap OK) and run the following to create a workspace environment var named `VISP_WS`:
\code
C:\> setx VISP_WS "C:\visp-ws"
C:\> exit
\endcode
Open a new `cmd` Command Prompt and create the corresponding folder
\code
C:\> mkdir %VISP_WS%
C:\> exit
\endcode

\section install_win10_msvc15_quick Quick ViSP installation

In this section, we give minimal instructions to build ViSP from source just to try ViSP without entering in \ref install_win10_msvc15_advanced.

- Open a new `cmd` Command Prompt and get ViSP source code in the workspace
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%
C:\> git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode
- Create a build directory
\code
C:\> mkdir %VISP_WS%\visp-build-vc15
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\visp-build-vc15
\endcode
- Run CMake in build directory (here the generator is chosen for Visual Studio 15 2017 and 64 bits hardware):
\code
C:\> cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" %VISP_WS%\visp
\endcode
- Build and install ViSP (installation doesn't need administrator privileges)
\code
C:\> cmake --build . --config Release --target install
\endcode
- ViSP is now installed in `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-vc15\install` folder
- Modify the `Path` var to add `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-vc15\install\x64\vc15\bin` corresponding to the path to ViSP libraries.
- Set `VISP_DIR` var to help CMake to find ViSP as a 3rd party
\code
C:\> setx VISP_DIR "%VISP_WS%\visp-build-vc15\install"
C:\> exit
\endcode

\note Since `setx` command is not able to handle a var that has more than 1024 characters (which could be the case of `Path` var), to modify `Path` environment variable do the following:
1. Open the Start Search, type in "env", and choose "Edit environment variables for your account"
2. Click the "Environment Variables..." button
3. Under the "User Variables" section (the upper half), find the row with "Path" in the first column, and click edit
4. The "Edit environment variable" UI will appear.
5. Click "New" button to add a new line with `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-vc15\install\x64\vc15\bin`

To have a trial, just jump to \ref install_win10_msvc15_dataset before running some binaries that you just build or jump to \ref install_win10_msvc15_next. You can later come back to the \ref install_win10_msvc15_advanced.

\section install_win10_msvc15_advanced Advanced ViSP installation

\subsection install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty Install 3rd parties

ViSP is interfaced with several 3rd party libraries. The <a href="https://visp.inria.fr/software-architecture">complete list is provided here</a>. We recommend to install \ref install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_opencv and \ref install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_xml in the workspace. If you have an Intel Realsense depth camera you may also install \ref install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_realsense. If your camera is a PointGrey you may install \ref install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_flycapture, while if your camera is a Basler, you may rather install \ref install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_pylon. If you want to be able to detect a QR code you may install \ref install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_zbar. To use optimized matrix operations you may install \ref install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_eigen. Other 3rd parties are optional and should be considered only by expert developers.

\subsubsection install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_opencv OpenCV 3rd party

<b>1. Get OpenCV</b>

First you have to get OpenCV:
- From http://opencv.org/releases.html download the latest OpenCV for Windows. In our case we got `opencv-4.0.0-vc14_vc15.exe` Win pack installer. The same procedure could be applied with the previous OpenCV 3.4.0 release downloading `opencv-3.4.0-vc14_vc15.exe`.
- Extract the content of the archive in your workspace `%%VISP_WS%`.
\image html img-win10-extract-opencv.png
- The installer extract all the material in `%%VISP_WS%\opencv`.
- We strongly recommend to rename this folder to a name that contain OpenCV version like `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.0.0`.

\note OpenCV 4.0.0 win pack installer contains prebuild OpenCV libraries build with Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64 (vc14) and Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64 (vc15). These libraries are located in `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.0.0\build\x64\vc14` and `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.0.0\build\x64\vc15` respectively.

<b>2. Complete OpenCV installation</b>

Now you have to complete OpenCV installation setting some environment vars:
- In order that ViSP detects OpenCV you have to set `OpenCV_DIR` environment variable. Start up a `cmd` Command Prompt and enter:
\code
C:\> setx OpenCV_DIR "%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.0.0\build"
C:\> exit
\endcode
where `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.0.0\build` is where you have installed OpenCV. Inside this folder you should have a file named `OpenCVConfig.cmake`. 

- You have also to add the location of OpenCV libraries corresponding to Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64 usage in the `Path` environment variable. Open the "Edit environment variable" UI, and modify `Path` to add a new line with `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.0.0\build\x64\vc15\bin`.

\subsubsection install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_xml libxml2 3rd party

<b>1. Get libxml2</b>

- Download the latest libxml2 release from ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2. At the time this tuto was written it was `libxml2-2.9.8.tag.gz` file.
- Extract the content of the tarball in your worksapce `%%VISP_WS%`. [Winrar](https://www.win-rar.com) could be used to this end.
- Here we suppose that you have libxml2 source code in `%%VISP_WS%\libxml2-2.9.8` folder.

<b>2. Build and install libxml2 from source</b>

- In the Windows "Start" menu, scroll to "Visual Studio 2017", and select "Visual Studio Command Prompt for native x64".
- To build libxml2 from source enter the following instructions in the Visual Studio Command Prompt:
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\libxml2-2.9.8\win32
C:\> cscript configure.js iconv=no ftp=no http=no compiler=msvc prefix=%VISP_WS%\libxml2-2.9.8\build-vc15
C:\> nmake /f Makefile.msvc install
\endcode
- After these steps, libxml2 library could be found in `%%VISP_WS\libxml2-2.9.8\build\vc15\bin\libxml2.dll`

<b>3. Complete libxml2 installation</b>

- To complete the installation, set `XML2_DIR` environment variable:
\code
C:\> setx XML2_DIR "%VISP_WS\libxml2-2.9.8\build-vc15"
C:\> exit
\endcode
- You have also to add the location of libxml2 library in the `Path` environment variable. Open the "Edit environment variable" UI, and modify `Path` to add a new line with `%%VISP_WS%\libxml2-2.9.8\build-vc15\bin`.

\subsubsection install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_realsense librealsense 3rd party

I you have an Intel RealSense Depth camera (SR300 or D400 series), you may install librealsense 2.x in order to use vpRealSense2 class. Otherwise you can skip this section.

Installation instructions are given in the <a href="https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/installation_windows.md">tutorial</a>. We recall the main steps here:

<b>1. Get librealsense</b>

- Open a new `cmd` Command Prompt and get ViSP source code in the workspace
\code
C:\> cd $VISP_WS
C:\> git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense.git

<b>2. Build and install librealsense from source</b>

- Create a build directory
\code
C:\> mkdir %VISP_WS%\librealsense\build-vc15
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\librealsense\build-vc15
\endcode
- Run CMake in build directory (here the generator is chosen for Visual Studio 15 2017 and 64 bits hardware and installation folder is set to the build folder):
\code
C:\> cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" %VISP_WS%\librealsense -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%VISP_WS%\librealsense\build-vc15
\endcode
- Build and install librealsense (installation doesn't need administrator privileges)
\code
C:\> cmake --build . --config Release --target install
\endcode
- librealsense is now installed in `%%VISP_WS%\librealsense\build-vc15` folder

<b>3. Complete librealsense installation</b>

- To complete the installation, set `REALSENSE2_DIR` environment variable:
\code
C:\> setx REALSENSE2_DIR "%VISP_WS\librealsense\build-vc15"
C:\> exit
\endcode
- You have also to add the location of librealsense library in the `Path` environment variable. Open the "Edit environment variable" UI, and modify `Path` to add a new line with `%%VISP_WS%\librealsense\build-vc15\bin`.

\subsubsection install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_flycapture FlyCapture 3rd party

I you have a PointGrey or FLIR USB 2.0, USB 3.0, GigE or FireWire camera (DragonFly2, Flea3...), you may install FlyCapture. Otherwise you can skip this section.

Complete installation instructions are given [here](https://www.ptgrey.com/KB/10020). We recap hereafter the main instructions to install FlyCapture SDK under Windows:

- Download the latest FlyCapture2 Full SDK for your camera from Point Grey’s [download site](https://eu.ptgrey.com/support/downloads). On the download page, select your product family and "Windows 10 64 bit" as operating system. At the time this tutorial we written we selected "FlyCapture 2.11.3.164 SDK - Windows (64 bit)" to download `FlyCapture_2.11.3.164_x64.exe` file.
- Double-click the downloaded software executable and follow the installation instructions.
- Select the correct driver for the camera when prompted by the installation instructions.
- Reboot the system.

\subsubsection install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_pylon Pylon 3rd party

- Click then on "Next" button.
- Select how your Basler camera is connected to the computer (USB, GigE, FireWire, Camera Link), then click on "Next" button.
- Keep the default destination folder as `C:\Program Files\Basler\pylon 5\` and click on "Next" button
- In the "Ready to install" panel, click on the "Install" button
- Reboot the system.

\subsubsection install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_zbar zbar 3rd party

If you want to work with QR codes (see \ref tutorial-detection-barcode), we recommend to install zbar 3rd party. Otherwise you can skip this section.
\note Since ViSP 3.1.0 we provide also AprilTag detection capabilities that are available without 3rd party installation (see \ref tutorial-detection-apriltag).

To install zbar you need to build the library from source. There is a fork of the library available from GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/dani4/ZBarWin64">https://github.com/dani4/ZBarWin64</a>) and adapted for compiling under Visual following the steps:

<b>1. Get zbar</b>

- Get ZBarWin64 source code from <a href="https://github.com/dani4/ZBarWin64">Github repository</a>. To this end open a `cmd` Command Prompt and hit:
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%
C:\> git clone https://github.com/dani4/ZBarWin64
\endcode

<b>2. Build zbar from source</b>
- Then open `%%VISP_WS%\ZBarWin64\zbar64.sln` solution file with Visual Studio C++
- Select `"Release"` and `"x64"` configuration. Then to build zbar library enter menu `"Build > Build Solution"` or hit "Ctrl+Shift+B".
\image html img-win10-msvc15-zbar-build.png

<b>3. Complete zbar installation</b>
- To complete the installation, set `ZBAR_DIR` environment variable:
\code
C:\> setx ZBAR_DIR "%VISP_WS%\ZBarWin64"
C:\> exit
\endcode
- You have also to add the location of zbar and iconv libraries in the `Path` environment variable. Open the "Edit environment variable" UI, and modify `Path` to add 2 new lines, one with `%%VISP_WS%\ZBarWin64\x64\Release`, another with `%%VISP_WS%\ZBarWin64\zbar\libiconv\dll_x64`.

\subsubsection install_win10_msvc15_3rdparty_eigen eigen 3rd party

Even if eigen is designed as a template we recommend to install the library with Visual Studio.

<b>1. Get eigen</b>

- Download the latest eigen release from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. At the time this tutorial was written we downloaded `eigen-eigen-323c052e1731.tar.gz` tarball corresponding to eigen 3.3.7.
- Extract the content of the archive in `%%VISP_WS%`.
- We recommend to rename `%%VISP_WS%\eigen-eigen-323c052e1731` in `%%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7`

<b>2. Build and install eigen from source</b>

- Create a build directory
\code
C:\> mkdir %VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-vc15
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-vc15
\endcode
- Run CMake in build directory (here the generator is chosen for Visual Studio 15 2017 and 64 bits hardware and installation folder is set to `%%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-vc15\install` folder):
\code
C:\> cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" %VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-vc15\install
\endcode
- Build and install eigen (installation doesn't need administrator privileges)
\code
C:\> cmake --build . --config Release --target install
\endcode
- eigen is now installed in `%%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-vc15\install` folder

<b>3. Complete eigen installation</b>

Now you have to complete eigen installation setting some environment vars:
- In order that ViSP detects eigen you have to set `EIGEN_DIR` environment variable. Start up a `cmd` Command Prompt and enter:
\code
C:\> setx Eigen3_DIR "%VISP_DIR%\eigen-3.3.7\build-vc15\install\share\eigen3\cmake"
C:\> exit
\endcode
where `%%VISP_DIR%\eigen-3.3.7\build-vc15\install` is where you have installed eigen. Inside the folder `share\eigen3\cmake` you should have a file named `Eigen3Config.cmake`.
- There is no need to set `Path` environment var since eigen is a template that has no library.

\subsection install_win10_msvc15_get_source Get ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code.

- You can download the <a href="https://visp.inria.fr/download">latest release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once `visp-x.y.z.tar.gz` or `visp-x.y.z.zip` is downloaded, uncompress the file in `%%VISP_WS%\visp\visp-x.y.z` using for axample <a href="http://www.win-rar.com">WinRAR</a>.

- You can also download a <a href="https://visp.inria.fr/download#snapshot">daily snapshot</a>. Once visp-snapshot-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz is downloaded, uncompress the file in `%%VISP_WS%\visp\visp-x.y.z` using for axample <a href="http://www.win-rar.com">WinRAR</a>.

- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from <a href="https://github.com/lagadic/visp">GitHub repository</a> using the `git` command line tool:
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%
C:\> git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in `%%VISP_WS%\visp`. 

\subsection install_win10_msvc15_config Configure ViSP from source 

The goal of the configuration step is now to use CMake to produce a Visual Studio C++ solution file that will be located in `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-vc15`.

- Launch CMake (cmake-gui) and complete the source code and binaries location as in the next image.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc15-visp-launch.png
- Click then on "Configure" button.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc15-visp-create-folder.png
- Click on "Yes" to create the `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-vc15` folder.
- Select then your compiler "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" and click on "Finish" button.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc15-msvc-version.png
- This will start CMake configuration. As shown in the next image, Eigen, Flycapture, GDI (Graphical Device Interface), OpenCV,  OpenMP, Pylon, Realsense, XML2 and Zbar 3rd parties are automatically detected. 
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc15-visp-config.png
\note Installation folder is set to `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-vc15/install`. If you want to change the installation folder to `C:\Program Files (x86)\ViSP`, make sure that you have administrator privileges to write in that folder before modifying `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. 

- Click then on "Configure" button. All the red lines should disappear.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc15-visp-config2.png
\note The default configuration lead to the creation of a shared library (with `.dll` extension). This is the default configuration that is recommended. If you want to create rather a static library (with `.lib` extension) you have to uncheck the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` option to disable DLL creation. 

- To finish the configuration, click on "Generate" button.
\image html img-cmake-win10-msvc15-visp-generate.png

- Once the generation is done, in `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-vc15` folder you have the Visual Studio `VISP.sln` generated solution file.

\subsection install_win10_msvc15_build Build and install ViSP libraries

- To build ViSP just double click on `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-vc15/VISP.sln` solution file. This action will open ViSP project in Visual Studio C++. By default, Visual Studio opens the solution in `Debug` configuration. Modify the configuration to `"Release"`.
\image html img-win10-msvc15-visp-open.png

- Enter menu `"Build > Build Solution"` to build ViSP or hit "Ctrl+Shift+B".

- At the end of the build process you should have the following indicating that all the build succeeded.
\image html img-win10-msvc15-visp-build-end.png

- Now to install ViSP, build `"INSTALL"` project. To this end, apply a left click on `"INSTALL"` to select the project, then a right click to enter in the "Build" menu.
\image html img-win10-msvc15-visp-install.png

- At the end of the installation, you should have the following.
\image html img-win10-msvc15-visp-install-end.png

- As shown in the previous image, all the headers but also the generated libraries are copied in `%%VISP_WS\visp-build-vc15\install` folder; headers and libraries in `include` and `x64/vc15` subfolders respectively.

- This ends ViSP installation in `"Release"` configuration. Now in `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-vc15/install/x64/vc15/bin` folder you have ViSP DLL libraries corresponding to ViSP modules.
\image html img-win10-msvc15-visp-explorer-install.png

- Note that you can also build ViSP in `Debug` configuration. In that case, all the library names are suffixed by "d" character (`libvisp_core320d.dll`...). 

\subsection install_win10_msvc15_env_var Set Path environment var

Modify the `Path` var to add the path to ViSP dll libraries. To this end open the "Edit environment variable" UI, and modify `Path` to add a new line with `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-vc15\install\x64\vc15\bin`.

\subsection install_win10_msvc15_visp_dir Set VISP_DIR environment var

In order to ease ViSP detection by CMake when ViSP is used as a 3rd party in an external project, like the one described in the \ref tutorial-getting-started, you may set `VISP_DIR` environment variable with the path to the `VISPConfig.cmake` file:
\code
C:\> setx VISP_DIR "%VISP_WS%\visp-build-vc15\install"
C:\> exit
\endcode

\section install_win10_msvc15_dataset Install ViSP data set

Some ViSP examples and tests require data (images, video, models) that are not part of ViSP source code but available in a separate archive named `visp-images-x.y.z.zip`. This archive could be downloaded from http://visp.inria.fr/download page. We provide here after the way to install these data if you want to run ViSP examples or tests. Note that ViSP tutorials are not using ViSP data set.

- Download `visp-images-3.2.0.zip` from https://visp.inria.fr/download and uncompress it in your workspace `%%VISP_WS%`.
\image html img-win10-visp-images.png

- ViSP examples and tests are able to detect automatically the location of the requested data if you position an environment variable called `VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH`. In our case, this variable should be set to `%%VISP_WS%\visp-images-3.2.0`. Open a `cmd` Command Prompt and run
\code
C:\> setx VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH %VISP_WS%\visp-images-3.2.0
C:\> exit
\endcode

- From now, you can try to run ViSP examples and tests. For example, if you want to run `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-vc15\example\device\display\Release\displayGDI.exe`, open a `cmd` Command Prompt, enter in the right folder and run:
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\visp-build-vc15\example\device\display\Release
C:\> displayGDI.exe

A click to close the windows...

A click to display a cross...
Cross position: 392, 306

A click to exit the program...
Bye
\endcode

\section install_msvc15_tips Tips and tricks

\subsection install_msvc15_tips_new_3rdparty How to take into account a newly installed 3rd party

Since all 3rd parties are optional you may have started to install only some of them. Imagine that you just installed a new third-party, or that you upgraded the version of this 3rd party. The next step is to go back to the build folder, configure ViSP with CMake to detect the newly installed third-party library and build again ViSP. This could be achieved with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build-msvc15
$ cmake ../visp
\endcode

Here you can check the content of the `ViSP-third-party.txt` file and see if the newly installed 3rd party is well detected.

Finally, you need to rebuild and install ViSP with:
\code
$ cmake --build . --config Release --target install
\endcode

\subsection install_msvc15_tips_uninstall How to uninstall ViSP
After ViSP installation, you can remove installed material using:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build-msvc15
$ cmake --build . --config Release --target uninstall
\endcode

\subsection install_msvc15_tips_modules How to build only ViSP libraries

If you want to build only ViSP modules libraries, nor the examples, tutorials and tests:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build-msvc15
$ cmake --build . --config Release --target visp_modules
\endcode

\subsection install_msvc15_tips_module_once How to build a ViSP specific module

If you want to build a given module and all the dependencies:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build-msvc15
$ cmake --build . --config Release --target visp_<module_name>
\endcode

For example to build the model-based tracker module named mbt, run:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build-msvc15
$ cmake --build . --config Release --target visp_mbt
\endcode

\subsection install_msvc15_tips_3rd_party Which are the 3rd party libraries that are used in ViSP ?

To see which are the optional 3rd parties that are found during the configuration stage and that will be used by ViSP during the build you can have a look to the text file named `ViSP-third-party.txt` and located in `$VISP_WS/visp-build`. We provide hereafter an example of a possible content of this file that contains also build info.
\code
$ type $VISP_WS/visp-build/ViSP-third-party.txt
