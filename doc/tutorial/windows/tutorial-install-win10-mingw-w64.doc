\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on Windows 10 with MinGW-W64. These steps have been tested with CMake 3.14.3 and MinGW-W64 - GCC for Windows 64 & 32 bits.

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_win10_mingw64_required Install prerequisities

\subsection install_win10_mingw64_required_mingw MinGW-W64

- You may first [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/installer/mingw-w64-install.exe) MinGW-W64 installer available [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/).
- Once downloaded execute `mingw-w64-install.exe`. It opens a window where you have to select some options. As in the next image, we recommend to select version 8.1.0 (the last version available when this tutorial was updated), architecture x86_64, posix threads that enables std::thread usage and exception seh (for Structured Exception Handling mechanism).
\image html img-win10-mingw-w64-installer.png
- Press Next button and keep default installation folder to `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0`
\image html img-win10-mingw-w64-installer-select-install-folder.png
- To finish the installation, just add `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin` folder to the `Path` variable. To this end open `cmd` Comand Prompt and do the following:
\code
C:\> setx Path "%Path%;C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin"
C:\> exit
\endcode
- To check if MinGW-W64 installation succeed, open a new `cmd` Command Prompt, and run:
\code
C:\> mingw32-make --version
GNU Make 4.2.1
Built for x86_64-w64-mingw32

C:\> g++ --version
g++ (x86_64-posix-seh-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 8.1.0
\endcode

\subsection install_win10_mingw64_3rd_cmake CMake

CMake could be download from http://www.cmake.org. Download the latest release for Windows win64-x64 platform (at the time this tutorial was written it was the file `cmake-3.14.3-win64-x64.msi`). To install just double click on the msi file.

\subsection install_win10_mingw64_3rd_git Git

Install Git for Windows from https://git-for-windows.github.io/. This installation allows then to use git in a `cmd` Command Prompt.

\section install_win10_mingw64_ws Create a workspace

If not already done, create a workspace that will contain all ViSP source, build, data set and optional 3rd parties. This workspace is here set to `C:\visp-ws` folder, but it could be set to any other location.

To create the workspace, open a `cmd` Command Prompt (a fast way to launch this window is to press the Win + R keys on your keyboard. Then, type `cmd` or `cmd.exe` and press Enter or click/tap OK) and run the following to create a workspace environment var named `VISP_WS`:
\code
C:\> setx VISP_WS "C:\visp-ws"
C:\> exit
\endcode
Open a new `cmd` Command Prompt and create the corresponding folder
\code
C:\> mkdir %VISP_WS%
C:\> exit
\endcode

\section install_win10_mingw64_quick Quick ViSP installation

In this section, we give minimal instructions to build ViSP from source just to try ViSP without entering in \ref install_win10_mingw64_advanced.

- Open a new `cmd` Command Prompt and get ViSP source code in the workspace
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%
C:\> git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode
- Create a build directory
\code
C:\> mkdir %VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw
\endcode
- Run CMake in build directory (here the generator is chosen for Visual Studio 15 2017 and 64 bits hardware):
\code
C:\> cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" %VISP_WS%\visp
\endcode
- Build and install ViSP (installation doesn't need administrator privileges)
\code
C:\> cmake --build . --config Release --target install -j4
\endcode
- ViSP is now installed in `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw\install` folder
- Modify the `Path` var to add `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw\install\x64\mingw\bin` corresponding to the path to ViSP libraries.
- Set `VISP_DIR` var to help CMake to find ViSP as a 3rd party
\code
C:\> setx VISP_DIR "%VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw\install"
C:\> exit
\endcode

\note Since `setx` command is not able to handle a var that has more than 1024 characters (which could be the case of `Path` var), to modify `Path` environment variable do the following:
1. Open the Start Search, type in "env", and choose "Edit environment variables for your account"
2. Click the "Environment Variables..." button
3. Under the "User Variables" section (the upper half), find the row with "Path" in the first column, and click edit
4. The "Edit environment variable" UI will appear.
5. Click "New" button to add a new line with `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw\install\x64\mingw\bin`

To have a trial, just jump to \ref install_win10_mingw64_dataset before running some binaries that you just build or jump to \ref install_win10_mingw64_next. You can later come back to the \ref install_win10_mingw64_advanced.

\section install_win10_mingw64_advanced Advanced ViSP installation

\subsection install_win10_mingw64_3rdparty Install 3rd parties

ViSP is interfaced with several 3rd party libraries. The <a href="https://visp.inria.fr/software-architecture">complete list is provided here</a>. We recommend to install \ref install_win10_mingw64_3rdparty_opencv in the workspace.

\subsubsection install_win10_mingw64_3rdparty_opencv OpenCV 3rd party

<b>1. Get OpenCV</b>

First you have to get OpenCV:
- From http://opencv.org/releases.html download the latest OpenCV for Windows. In our case we got `opencv-4.1.1-vc14_vc15.exe` Win pack installer. The same procedure could be applied with all the previous OpenCV releases starting from 3.4.0 version.
- Extract the content of the archive in your workspace `%%VISP_WS%`.
\image html img-win10-extract-opencv.png
- The installer extract all the material in `%%VISP_WS%\opencv`.
- We strongly recommend to rename this folder to a name that contain OpenCV version like `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1`.

\note OpenCV 4.1.1 win pack installer contains prebuild OpenCV libraries build with Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64 (vc14) and Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64 (vc15) but there is no build for MinGW. That's why you need to build yourself OpenCV from source and install the libraries in `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1\build\x64\mingw`.

<b>2. Configure, build and install OpenCV from source</b>

- Open a `cmd` Command Prompt and create a build folder 
\code
C:\> mkdir %VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1\build-mingw
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1\build-mingw
\endcode
- Run CMake in build directory and set the install dir to `%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1\build`. We disable also tests build in order to speed up the build process:
\code
C:\> cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..\sources -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1\build -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_PERF_TESTS=OFF -DWITH_OPENCL_D3D11_NV=OFF
\endcode
- Build and install OpenCV for MinGW (installation doesn't need administrator privileges)
\code
C:\> cmake --build . --config Release --target install -j4
\endcode
- OpenCV is now installed in `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1\build` folder

\note With OpenCV 4.1.0 if you don't set `WITH_OPENCL_D3D11_NV=OFF` you will get an \ref issue_win10_mingw_opencv_opencl_d3d11.
\note Using OpenCV older versions you may encounter the following issues, for which we propose work arrounds; \ref issue_win10_mingw_opencv_precompiled_headers, \ref issue_win10_mingw_opencv_cap_dshow, \ref issue_win10_mingw_opencv_dtor, \ref issue_win10_mingw_opencv_tiff, or \ref issue_win10_mingw_opencv_ipp.

<b>3. Complete OpenCV installation</b>

Now you have to complete OpenCV installation setting some environment vars:
- In order that ViSP detects OpenCV you have to set `OpenCV_DIR` environment variable. Start up a `cmd` Command Prompt and enter:
\code
C:\> setx OpenCV_DIR "%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1\build"
C:\> exit
\endcode
where `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.0.0\build` is where you have installed OpenCV. Inside this folder you should have a file named `OpenCVConfig.cmake`. 

- You have also to add the location of OpenCV libraries corresponding to MinGW usage in the `Path` environment variable. Open the "Edit environment variable" UI, and modify `Path` to add a new line with `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1\build\x64\mingw\bin`.

\subsubsection install_win10_mingw64_3rdparty_eigen Eigen3 3rd party

Even if Eigen3 is designed as a template we recommend to install the library with MinGW.

<b>1. Get Eigen3</b>

- Download the latest Eigen3 release from http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. At the time this tutorial was written we downloaded `eigen-eigen-323c052e1731.zip` archive corresponding to Eigen 3.3.7.
- Extract the content of the archive in `%%VISP_WS%`.
- We recommend to rename `%%VISP_WS%\eigen-eigen-323c052e1731` in `%%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7`

<b>2. Build and install Eigen3 from source</b>

- Create a build directory
\code
C:\> mkdir %VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-mingw
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-mingw
\endcode
- Run CMake in build directory (here the generator is chosen for MinGW and installation folder is set to `%%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-mingw\install` folder):
\code
C:\> cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" %VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-mingw\install
\endcode
- Build and install Eigen3 (installation doesn't need administrator privileges)
\code
C:\> cmake --build . --config Release --target install -j4
\endcode
- Eigen3 is now installed in `%%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-mingw\install` folder.

<b>3. Complete Eigen3 installation</b>

Now you have to complete Eigen3 installation setting some environment vars:
- In order that ViSP detects eigen you have to set `EIGEN_DIR` environment variable. Start up a `cmd` Command Prompt and enter:
\code
C:\> setx Eigen3_DIR "%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-mingw\install\share\eigen3\cmake"
C:\> exit
\endcode
where `%%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-mingw\install` is where you have installed Eigen3. Inside the folder `%%VISP_WS%\eigen-3.3.7\build-mingw\install\share\eigen3\cmake` you should have a file named `Eigen3Config.cmake`.
- There is no need to set `Path` environment var since Eigen3 is a template that has no library.


\subsection install_win10_mingw64_get_source Get ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code.

- You can download the <a href="https://visp.inria.fr/download">latest release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once `visp-x.y.z.tar.gz` or `visp-x.y.z.zip` is downloaded, uncompress the file in `%%VISP_WS%\visp\visp-x.y.z` using for axample <a href="http://www.win-rar.com">WinRAR</a>.

- You can also download a <a href="https://visp.inria.fr/download#snapshot">daily snapshot</a>. Once visp-snapshot-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz is downloaded, uncompress the file in `%%VISP_WS%\visp\visp-x.y.z` using for axample <a href="http://www.win-rar.com">WinRAR</a>.

- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from <a href="https://github.com/lagadic/visp">GitHub repository</a> using the `git` command line tool:
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%
C:\> git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in `%%VISP_WS%\visp`.

\subsection install_win10_mingw64_config Configure ViSP from source 

The goal of the configuration step is now to use CMake to produce a Visual Studio C++ solution file that will be located in `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-mingw`.

- Launch CMake (cmake-gui) and complete the source code and binaries location as in the next image.
\image html img-cmake-win10-mingw-visp-launch.png
- Click then on "Configure" button.
\image html img-cmake-win10-mingw-visp-create-folder.png
- Click on "Yes" to create the `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-mingw` folder.
- Select then your compiler "MinGW Makefiles" and click on "Finish" button.
\image html img-cmake-win10-mingw-makefiles.png
- This will start CMake configuration. As shown in the next image, OpenCV, GDI (Graphical Device Interface), Eigen3, libjpeg, libpng and pthread 3rd parties are automatically detected. 
\image html img-cmake-win10-mingw-visp-config.png
\note If OpenCV is not detected, you may encounter the following issue \ref issue_win10_mingw_opencv_not_detected.

\note Installation folder is set to `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-mingw/install`. If you want to change the installation folder to `C:/Program Files (x86)/ViSP`, make sure that you have administrator privileges to write in that folder before modifying `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. 

- Click then on "Configure" button. All the red lines should disappear.
\note The default configuration lead to the creation of a shared library (with `.dll` extension). This is the default configuration that is recommended. If you want to create rather a static library (with `.lib` extension) you have to uncheck the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` option to disable DLL creation. 

- To finish the configuration, click on "Generate" button.
\image html img-cmake-win10-mingw-visp-generate.png

- Once the generation is done, in `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-mingw` folder you have the Makefile file that will be used by MinGW to build the whole project.

\subsection install_win10_mingw64_build Build and install ViSP libraries

- To build ViSP, open a `cmd` Command Prompt, change to `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw` folder and run `mingw32-make`:
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw
C:\> mingw32-make -j4
\endcode

- Now to install ViSP, in the same `cmd` Command Prompt run:
\code
C:\> mingw32-make -j4 install
\endcode

- At the end, in `%%VISP_WS%/visp-build-mingw/install/x64/mingw/bin` folder you will find ViSP DLL libraries corresponding to the build modules. 
\note When `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is set to Debug, the library names are suffixed by "d".

\subsection install_win10_mingw64_env_var Set Path environment var

Modify the `Path` var to add the path to ViSP dll libraries. To this end open the "Edit environment variable" UI, and modify `Path` to add a new line with `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw\install\x64\mingw\bin`.

\subsection install_win10_mingw64_visp_dir Set VISP_DIR environment var

In order to ease ViSP detection by CMake when ViSP is used as a 3rd party in an external project, like the one described in the \ref tutorial-getting-started, you may set `VISP_DIR` environment variable with the path to the `VISPConfig.cmake` file:
\code
C:\> setx VISP_DIR "%VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw\install"
C:\> exit
\endcode

\section install_win10_mingw64_dataset Install ViSP data set

Some ViSP examples and tests require data (images, video, models) that are not part of ViSP source code.
They are available in Github (https://github.com/lagadic/visp-images) or in a separate archive named `visp-images-x.y.z.zip`.
This archive could be downloaded from http://visp.inria.fr/download page. We provide here after the way to install these data from Github if you want to run ViSP examples or tests. Note that ViSP tutorials are not using ViSP data set.

- Enter in your workspace `%%VISP_WS%` and clone the latest data set:
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%
C:\> git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp-images
\endcode
\image html img-win10-visp-images-git.png

- ViSP examples and tests are able to detect automatically the location of the requested data if you position an environment variable called `VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH`. In our case, this variable should be set to `%%VISP_WS%\visp-images`. Open a `cmd` Command Prompt and run
\code
C:\> setx VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH %VISP_WS%\visp-images
C:\> exit
\endcode

- From now, you can try to run ViSP examples and tests. For example, if you want to run `%%VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw\example\device\display\displayGDI.exe`, open a `cmd` Command Prompt, enter in the right folder and run:
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\visp-build-mingw\example\device\display
C:\> displayGDI.exe

A click to close the windows...

A click to display a cross...
Cross position: 392, 306

A click to exit the program...
Bye
\endcode

\section install_mingw64_tips Tips and tricks

\subsection install_mingw64_tips_new_3rdparty How to take into account a newly installed 3rd party

Since all 3rd parties are optional you may have started to install only some of them. Imagine that you just installed a new third-party, or that you upgraded the version of this 3rd party. The next step is to go back to the build folder, configure ViSP with CMake to detect the newly installed third-party library and build again ViSP. This could be achieved with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build-mingw
$ cmake ../visp
\endcode

Here you can check the content of the `ViSP-third-party.txt` file and see if the newly installed 3rd party is well detected.

Finally, you need to rebuild ViSP with:
\code
$ mingw32-make
\endcode

\subsection install_mingw64_tips_uninstall How to uninstall ViSP
After ViSP installation, you can remove installed material using:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build-mingw
$ mingw32-make uninstall
\endcode

\subsection install_mingw64_tips_modules How to build only ViSP libraries

If you want to build only ViSP modules libraries, nor the examples, tutorials and tests:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS%/visp-build-mingw
$ mingw32-make visp_modules
\endcode

\subsection install_mingw64_tips_module_once How to build a ViSP specific module

If you want to build a given module and all the dependencies:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS%/visp-build-mingw
$ mingw32-make visp_<module_name>
\endcode

For example to build the model-based tracker module named mbt, run:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS%/visp-build-mingw
$ mingw32-make visp_mbt
\endcode

\subsection install_mingw64_tips_3rd_party Which are the 3rd party libraries that are used in ViSP ?

To see which are the optional 3rd parties that are found during the configuration stage and that will be used by ViSP during the build you can have a look to the text file named `ViSP-third-party.txt` and located in `%VISP_WS%/visp-build-mingw`. We provide hereafter an example of a possible content of this file that contains also build info.
\code
$ type %VISP_WS%/visp-build-mingw/ViSP-third-party.txt

\section issue_win10_mingw Known issues

\subsection issue_win10_mingw_opencv_opencl_d3d11 OpenCL D3D11 build failure

This issue occurs with OpenCV 4.1.1 and is referenced [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/14286).

If you encounter the following issue during OpenCV build:
\image html img-mingw-issue-opencv-d3d11.png
you have to disable OpenCL D3D11 support and restart a new build:
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1\build-mingw
C:\> cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..\sources -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%VISP_WS%\opencv-4.1.1\build -DWITH_OPENCL_D3D11_NV=OFF
C:\> cmake --build . --config Release --target install
\endcode

\subsection issue_win10_mingw_opencv_endianness OpenCV endianness failure during CMake configuration

\note This issue occurs with OpenCV 2.4.10, 2.3.0-beta and 2.3.0 releases.

If you encounter the following issue during CMake configuration
\image html img-opencv-issue-test-big-endian.jpg

Edit `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-2.y.z\sources\CMakeLists.txt` file, and line 464 replace:
\code
test_big_endian(WORDS_BIGENDIAN)
\endcode
by:
\code
#test_big_endian(WORDS_BIGENDIAN)
set(WORDS_BIGENDIAN 0)
\endcode

\subsection issue_win10_mingw_opencv_tiff OpenCV build error: cannot build with tiff support

\note This issue occurs with OpenCV 2.4.10, 2.3.0-beta and 2.3.0 releases.

If you encounter a build issue during libtiff build as given in the next image:
\image html img-opencv-issue-tiff.jpg

- Open CMake GUI on OpenCV, turn BUILD_TIFF=OFF and also WITH_TIFF=OFF
- Click on "Configure" button, and then on "Generate" one.
- Build again OpenCV using
\code
cd %VISP_WS%\opencv-2.y.z\sources\build-mingw
C:\> mingw32-make
\endcode

\subsection issue_win10_mingw_opencv_ipp OpenCV link error: cannot find -lRunTmChk

\note This issue occurs with OpenCV 2.3.0-beta and 2.3.0 releases.

The following image shows the link issue that may appear when building OpenCV with MinGW:
\image html img-opencv-issue-ipp.jpg

A work arround is to configure OpenCV without ipp support turning WITH_IPP=OFF and then trying to build again.

\subsection issue_win10_mingw_opencv_dtor OpenCV build error: struct has virtual functions and accessible non-virtual destructor

This error that occurs with OpenCV 3.0.0 during `cap_dshow.cpp` build is known and reported as an issue in https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/pull/5282/commits.
\image html img-win8.1-mingw-opencv-issue-dtor.jpg 

- The fix consists in modifying `modules/videoio/src/cap_dshow.cpp` by adding near line 96:
\code
#ifdef __MINGW32__
// MinGW does not understand COM interfaces
#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wnon-virtual-dtor"
#endif
\endcode

\subsection issue_win10_mingw_opencv_not_detected OpenCV not detected with Mingw build

\note This issue occurs with OpenCV 2.4.9, 2.4.10 and 2.3.0-beta.

- To fix this issue, edit `%%VISP_WS%\opencv-2.y.z\sources\cmake\OpenCVConfig.cmake`, and line 89 replace:
\code
  if(CMAKE_OPENCV_GCC_TARGET_MACHINE MATCHES "64")
\endcode
by:
\code
  if(OPENCV_GCC_TARGET_MACHINE MATCHES "64")
\endcode

- Then open a new `cmd` Command Prompt to build and install OpenCV again:
\code
C:\> cd %VISP_WS%\opencv-2.y.z\sources\build-mingw
C:\> mingw32-make install
\endcode

\subsection issue_win10_mingw_opencv_precompiled_headers windres.exe invalid option --W

\note This issue occurs with OpenCV 3.3.0.

When running `mingw32-make` if you get the following issue:
\image html img-win10-mingw-opencv-issue-precompiled-headers.png

the workarround consists in:
- opening cmake-gui and turning `ENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS` cmake var OFF:
\image html img-cmake-win10-mingw-opencv-issue-precompiled-headers.png
- in cmake-gui press "Configure" button, then press "Generate" button
- then in the `cmd` Command Prompt run again `mingw32-make`

\subsection issue_win10_mingw_opencv_cap_dshow Build error in cap_dshow.cpp 

\note This issue occurs with OpenCV 3.3.0.

When running `mingw32-make` if you get the following issue:
\image html img-win10-mingw-opencv-issue-cap-dshow.png

the workarround consists in:
- editing `%%VISP_WS%/opencv-3.3.0/sources/modules/videoio/src/cap_dshow.cpp` adding
\code
#define NO_DSHOW_STRSAFE
\endcode
before the line
\code
#include "DShow.h"
\endcode
- then in the `cmd` Command Prompt run again `mingw32-make`
