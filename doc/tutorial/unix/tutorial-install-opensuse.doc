\page tutorial-install-opensuse Tutorial: Installation from source for Linux openSUSE
\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on openSUSE. These steps have been tested for openSUSE 14.1 (x86_64) and openSUSE Leap 42.3 (x86_64) distro, but should work with any other distribution as well. 

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_opensuse_ws Create a workspace

First create a workspace that will contain all ViSP source, build, data set and optional 3rd parties. This workspace is here set to `$HOME/visp-ws` folder, but it could be set to any other location.

In a terminal, run:
\code
$ echo "export VISP_WS=$HOME/visp-ws" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ mkdir -p $VISP_WS
\endcode

\section install_opensuse_required Install prerequisites

Prior to build and install ViSP from source, you may install GNU g++ compiler, CMake, git and subversion. This can be achieved running:
\code
$ sudo zypper install gcc-c++ cmake git subversion wget
\endcode

\section install_opensuse_quick Quick ViSP installation

In this section, we give minimal instructions to build ViSP from source just to try ViSP without entering in \ref install_opensuse_advanced.

- Install a small number of recommended 3rd parties
\code
$ sudo zypper install opencv-devel libX11-devel lapack-devel eigen3-devel libdc1394-devel libv4l-devel libzbar-devel libjpeg8-devel libpng-devel
\endcode

- Get ViSP source code
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

- Create a build folder and build ViSP
\code
$ mkdir -p $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
$ make -j4
\endcode

- Set `VISP_DIR` environment variable
\code
$ echo "export VISP_DIR=$VISP_WS/visp-build" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

To have a trial, just jump to \ref install_opensuse_dataset before running some binaries that you just build or jump to \ref install_opensuse_next. You can later come back to the \ref install_opensuse_advanced. 

\section install_opensuse_advanced Advanced ViSP installation

\subsection install_opensuse_3rdparty Install 3rd parties

ViSP is interfaced with several 3rd party libraries. The <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/software-architecture">complete list is provided here</a>.

\note ViSP can be used without any third-party since all of them are optional. But obviously in this case, as we do not want to reinvent the wheel, some features implemented in third-party libraries will not be exploitable through ViSP. It is therefore possible to skip in a first time this section and start directly to \ref install_opensuse_quick. Later, if you realize that a third-party library is missing, you can still install it, go back to the build folder, configure ViSP with CMake to detect the newly installed third-party library and build ViSP again as explained in \ref install_opensuse_tips_new_3rdparty.

\subsubsection install_opensuse_3rdparty_recommended Recommended 3rd parties

We recommend to install the following:

- OpenCV
- libX11 to be able to open a window to display images
- lapack and eigen to benefit from optimized mathematical capabilities
- libdc1394 to grab images from firewire cameras
- libv4l to grab images from usb or analogic cameras
- libzbar to be able to detect QR codes

Installation of recommended 3rd parties could be performed running:
\code
$ sudo zypper install opencv-devel libX11-devel lapack-devel eigen3-devel libdc1394-devel libv4l-devel libzbar-devel
\endcode

\subsubsection install_opensuse_3rdparty_other Other optional 3rd parties

We give also the way to install other 3rd party libraries to enable specific capabilities.

- libjpeg and libpng to support jpeg and png images (only useful if OpenCV is not installed)
\code
$ sudo zypper install libjpeg8-devel libpng-devel
\endcode

\subsection install_opensuse_get_source Get ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code in this workspace:

- You can download the <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download">latest release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using either
\code
$ tar xvzf visp-x.y.z.tar.gz -C $VISP_WS
\endcode
or
\code
$ unzip visp-x.y.z.zip -d $VISP_WS
\endcode

- You can also download a <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download#snapshot">daily snapshot</a>. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using
\code
$ tar xvzf visp-snapshot-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz -C $VISP_WS
\endcode

- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from <a href="https://github.com/lagadic/visp">GitHub repository</a> using the following command
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in the directory `$VISP_WS/visp`. The following should be adapted if you downloaded ViSP from a zip or tarball. In that case, the source is rather in something like `$VISP_WS/visp-x.y.z`.

\subsection install_opensuse_config Configure ViSP from source

These are the steps to configure ViSP from source with CMake:

- In the workspace, create first a directory named `visp-build` that will contain all the build material; generated Makefiles, object files, output libraries and binaries.
\code
$ mkdir $VISP_WS/visp-build
\endcode

- Enter the `visp-build` folder and configure the build:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
\endcode
A more versatile way to configure the build is to use `ccmake`, the CMake GUI:
\code
$ ccmake ../visp
\endcode
The following image shows that this command allows to configure (just by pressing [c] key) the build in a more advanced way where some options could be easily turned ON/OFF. It allows also to see which are the 3rd parties that will be used. To generate the makefiles, just press [g] key in the ccmake gui.
\image html img-ccmake-opensuse-all.png Snapshot of the `ccmake ../visp` command used to configure ViSP.

\subsection install_opensuse_build Build ViSP libraries

To build ViSP libraries proceed with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ make -j4
\endcode

\subsection install_opensuse_doc Build ViSP documentation

To build ViSP documentation, you have first to install Doxygen package:
\code
$ sudo zypper install doxygen graphviz
\endcode
Then you can proceed with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
$ make -j4 visp_doc
\endcode
The generated documentation is then available in `$VISP_WS/visp-build/doc/html/index.html`

\note It is also possible to generate a more complete documentation that includes also all the internal classes. This could be achieved setting CMake var `ENABLE_FULL_DOC` to `ON` like:
\code
$ cmake ../visp -DENABLE_FULL_DOC=ON
$ make -j4 visp_doc
\endcode

\subsection install_opensuse_visp_dir Set VISP_DIR environment var

In order to ease ViSP detection by CMake when ViSP is used as a 3rd party in an external project, like the one described in the \ref tutorial-getting-started, you may set `VISP_DIR` environment variable with the path to the `VISPConfig.cmake` file:
\code
$ echo "export VISP_DIR=$VISP_WS/visp-build" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

\section install_opensuse_dataset Install ViSP data set

Some ViSP examples and tests require a data set that contains images, video, models that is not part of ViSP source code. This data set is available in Github (https://github.com/lagadic/visp-images) or as a release in a separate archive named `visp-images-x.y.z.zip`. This archive could be downloaded from http://visp.inria.fr/download page. Note that ViSP tutorials are not using ViSP data set.

We give hereafter the two ways to get this data set:

<b>1. Get data set release</b>

- Download `visp-images-3.3.0.zip` from https://visp.inria.fr/download and uncompress it in your workspace `%%VISP_WS%`:
\code
$ unzip ~/Downloads/visp-images-3.2.0.zip -d $VISP_WS
\endcode
- We suppose now that the data are located in `$VISP_WS/visp-images-3.3.0`.
\code
$ ls $VISP_WS/visp-images-3.3.0
3dmodel	   LICENSE.txt    circle     ellipse-1    iv      mbt-depth     video
AprilTag   README.md      cube       endianness   line    mire          warp
Klimt      calibration    ellipse    faces        mbt     mire-2        xml
\endcode
- Once downloaded, you need to set `VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH` environment variable to help ViSP examples and tests to detect automatically the location of the requested data. In our case, this variable should be set to `$VISP_WS/visp-images-3.3.0`. It is more convenient if this environment variables is automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched: 
\code
$ echo "export VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH=$VISP_WS/visp-images-3.3.0" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

<b>2. Get data set from github</b>

- Use git to get the data set latest version:
\code
C:\> cd $VISP_WS
C:\> git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp-images.git
\endcode
- Once cloned, you need to set `VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH` environment variable to help ViSP examples and tests to detect automatically the location of the requested data. In our case, this variable should be set to `$VISP_WS%/visp-images`. In a shell run:
\code
$ echo "export VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH=$VISP_WS/visp-images" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

<b>Test data set usage</b>

- From now, you can try to run ViSP examples and tests. For example you can run `displayX` example that should open a windows with Klimt painting image and some overlay drawings:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ ./example/device/display/displayX

A click to close the windows...

A click to display a cross...
Cross position: 201, 441

A click to exit the program...
Bye
\endcode

\section install_opensuse_tips Tips and tricks

\subsection install_opensuse_tips_new_3rdparty How to take into account a newly installed 3rd party

Since all 3rd parties are optional you may have started to install only some of them. Imagine that you just installed a new third-party, or that you upgraded the version of this 3rd party. The next step is to go back to the build folder, configure ViSP with CMake to detect the newly installed third-party library and build again ViSP. This could be achieved with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
\endcode

Here you can check the content of the `ViSP-third-party.txt` file and see if the newly installed 3rd party is well detected (see \ref install_opensuse_tips_3rd_party).

Finally, you need to rebuild ViSP with:
\code
$ make -j4
\endcode

\subsection install_opensuse_tips_install How to install ViSP

Installing ViSP is optional and not recommended, since ViSP could be used as a 3rd party without installation. If you still want to proceed with the installation run:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ sudo make install
\endcode
\note The default install location is set to `/usr/local`. This location could be changed modifying `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` var:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
\endcode

\note If you proceed to ViSP installation in a system folder like `/usr` or `/usr/local` there is no need to \ref install_opensuse_visp_dir that helps CMake to find ViSP libraries in an external project that uses ViSP as a 3rd party. If you rather install ViSP in a non "standard" folder, let say `/my/install/folder`, you have to set `VISP_DIR` to `/my/install/folder/lib/cmake/visp` that contains the `VISPConfig.cmake` file:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/install/folder
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
$ echo "export VISP_DIR=/my/install/folder/lib/cmake/visp" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

\subsection install_opensuse_tips_uninstall How to uninstall ViSP

After ViSP installation, you can remove installed material using:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ sudo make uninstall
\endcode

\subsection install_opensuse_tips_modules How to build only ViSP libraries

If you want to build only ViSP modules libraries, nor the examples, tutorials and tests:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ make -j4 visp_modules
\endcode

\subsection install_opensuse_tips_module_once How to build a ViSP specific module

If you want to build a given module and all the dependencies:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ make -j4 visp_<module_name>
\endcode

For example to build the model-based tracker module named mbt, run:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ make -j4 visp_mbt
\endcode

\subsection install_opensuse_tips_target Which are the targets that could be run with make ?

To know which are the target available with `make`:
\code
$ make help | grep visp
... visp_tutorials
... visp_tests
... visp_modules
... visp_doc
... visp_examples
... visp_demos
... visp_clipper
... visp_apriltag
... visp_core
... visp_gui
... visp_imgproc
... visp_io
... gen_visp_java_source
... visp_klt
... visp_me
... visp_sensor
... visp_ar
... visp_blob
... visp_robot
... visp_visual_features
... visp_vs
... visp_vision
... visp_detection
... visp_mbt
... visp_tt
... visp_tt_mi
\endcode

\subsection install_opensuse_tips_3rd_party Which are the 3rd party libraries that are used in ViSP ?

To see which are the optional 3rd parties that are found during the configuration stage and that will be used by ViSP during the build you can have a look to the text file named `ViSP-third-party.txt` and located in `$VISP_WS/visp-build`. We provide hereafter an example of a possible content of this file:
\code
$ cat $VISP_WS/visp-build/ViSP-third-party.txt
