\page tutorial-install-centos Tutorial: Installation from source for Linux CentOS
\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on CentOS. These steps have been tested with CentOS 7.0 (x86_64) and with CentOS 7.2 (x86_64) distro, but should work with any other distribution as well. 

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_centos_required Install prerequisites

Prior to build and install ViSP from source, you may install GNU g++ compiler, CMake, git and subversion. This can be achieved running:
\code
$ sudo yum install gcc-c++ make cmake git subversion wget
\endcode

\section install_centos_ws Create a workspace

First create a workspace that will contain all ViSP source, build, data set and optional 3rd parties. This workspace is here set to `$HOME/visp-ws` folder, but it could be set to any other location.

In a terminal, run:
\code
$ echo "export VISP_WS=$HOME/visp-ws" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ mkdir -p $VISP_WS
\endcode

\section install_centos_quick Quick ViSP installation

In this section, we give minimal instructions to build ViSP from source just to try ViSP without entering in \ref install_centos_advanced.

- Install a small number of recommended 3rd parties
\code
$ sudo yum install opencv-devel libX11-devel lapack-devel libv4l-devel libjpeg-devel libpng-devel
\endcode

- Get ViSP source code
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

- Create a build folder and build ViSP
\code
$ mkdir -p $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
$ make -j4
\endcode

- Set `VISP_DIR` environment variable
\code
$ echo "export VISP_DIR=$VISP_WS/visp-build" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

To have a trial, just jump to \ref install_centos_dataset before running some binaries that you just build or jump to \ref install_centos_next. You can later come back to the \ref install_centos_advanced.

\section install_centos_advanced Advanced ViSP installation

\subsection install_centos_3rdparty Install 3rd parties

ViSP is interfaced with several 3rd party libraries. The <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/software-architecture">complete list is provided here</a>.

\note ViSP can be used without any third-party since all of them are optional. But obviously in this case, as we do not want to reinvent the wheel, some features implemented in third-party libraries will not be exploitable through ViSP. It is therefore possible to skip in a first time this section and start directly to \ref install_centos_quick. Later, if you realize that a third-party library is missing, you can still install it, go back to the build folder, configure ViSP with CMake to detect the newly installed third-party library and build ViSP again as explained in \ref install_centos_tips_new_3rdparty.

\subsubsection install_centos_3rdparty_recommended Recommended 3rd parties

We recommend to install the following:

- OpenCV
- libX11 to be able to open a window to display images
- lapack and eigen to benefit from optimized mathematical capabilities
- libdc1394 to grab images from firewire cameras
- libv4l to grab images from usb or analogic cameras

Installation of recommended 3rd parties could be performed running:
\code
$ sudo yum install opencv-devel libX11-devel lapack-devel libv4l-devel
\endcode

\subsubsection install_centos_3rdparty_other Other optional 3rd parties

We give also the way to install other 3rd party libraries to enable specific capabilities.

- libjpeg and libpng to support jpeg and png images respectively (only useful if OpenCV is not installed)
\code
$ sudo yum install libjpeg-devel libpng-devel
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_get_source Get ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code:

- You can download the <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download">latest release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using either
\code
$ tar xvzf visp-x.y.z.tar.gz -C $VISP_WS
\endcode
or
\code
$ unzip visp-x.y.z.zip -d $VISP_WS
\endcode

- You can also download a <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download#snapshot">daily snapshot</a>. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using
\code
$ tar xvzf visp-snapshot-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz -C $VISP_WS
\endcode

- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from <a href="https://github.com/lagadic/visp">GitHub repository</a> using the following command
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in the directory `$VISP_WS/visp`. The following should be adapted if you downloaded ViSP from a zip or tarball. In that case, the source is rather in something like `$VISP_WS/visp-x.y.z`.

\subsection install_centos_config Configure ViSP from source

These are the steps to configure ViSP from source with CMake:

- In the workspace, create first a directory named `visp-build` that will contain all the build material; generated Makefiles, object files, output libraries and binaries.
\code
$ mkdir $VISP_WS/visp-build
\endcode

- Enter the `visp-build` folder and configure the build:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
\endcode
A more versatile way to configure the build is to use `ccmake`, the CMake GUI:
\code
$ ccmake ../visp
\endcode
The following image shows that this command allows to configure (just by pressing [c] key) the build in a more advanced way where some options could be easily turned ON/OFF. It allows also to see which are the 3rd parties that will be used. To generate the makefiles, just press [g] key in the ccmake gui.
\image html img-ccmake-centos-all.jpg Snapshot of the `ccmake ../visp command used to configure ViSP.

\subsection install_centos_build Build ViSP libraries

To build ViSP libraries proceed with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ make -j4
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_doc Build ViSP documentation

To build ViSP documentation, you have first to install Doxygen package:
\code
$ sudo yum install doxygen graphviz
\endcode
Then you can proceed with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
$ make -j4 visp_doc
\endcode
The generated documentation is then available in `$VISP_WS/visp-build/doc/html/index.html`

\note It is also possible to generate a more complete documentation that includes also all the internal classes. This could be achieved setting CMake var `ENABLE_FULL_DOC` to `ON` like:
\code
$ cmake ../visp -DENABLE_FULL_DOC=ON
$ make -j4 visp_doc
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_visp_dir Set VISP_DIR environment var

In order to ease ViSP detection by CMake when ViSP is used as a 3rd party in an external project, like the one described in the \ref tutorial-getting-started, you may set `VISP_DIR` environment variable with the path to the `VISPConfig.cmake` file:
\code
$ echo "export VISP_DIR=$VISP_WS/visp-build" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

\section install_centos_dataset Install ViSP dataset

Some ViSP examples and tests require data (images, video, models) that are not part of ViSP source code but available in a separate archive named `visp-images-x.y.z.zip`. This archive could be downloaded from http://visp.inria.fr/download page. We provide here after the way to install these data if you want to run ViSP examples or tests. Note that ViSP tutorials are not using ViSP data set.

- Get ViSP data set and unzip the archive
\code
$ wget http://visp-doc.inria.fr/download/dataset/visp-images-3.2.0.zip --directory-prefix=$VISP_WS
$ unzip $VISP_WS/visp-images-3.2.0.zip -d $VISP_WS
\endcode

- We suppose now that the data are located in `$VISP_WS/visp-images-3.2.0`.
\code
$ ls $VISP_WS/visp-images-3.2.0
AprilTag   LICENSE.txt   calibration   cube      ellipse-1    iv     mbt         mire     video
Klimt      README.md     circle	       ellipse	 endianness   line   mbt-depth   mire-2
\endcode

- Set `VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH` environment variable to help ViSP examples and tests to find the location of the data set. It is more convenient if this environment variables is automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched: 
\code
$ echo "export VISP_WS=$HOME/visp-ws" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH=$VISP_WS/visp-images-3.2.0" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

- From now, you can try to run ViSP examples and tests. For example you can run `displayX` example that should open a windows with Klimt painting image and some overlay drawings:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ ./example/device/display/displayX

A click to close the windows...

A click to display a cross...
Cross position: 201, 441

A click to exit the program...
Bye
\endcode

\section install_centos_tips Tips and tricks

\subsection install_centos_tips_new_3rdparty How to take into account a newly installed 3rd party

Since all 3rd parties are optional you may have started to install only some of them. Imagine that you just installed a new third-party, or that you upgraded the version of this 3rd party. The next step is to go back to the build folder, configure ViSP with CMake to detect the newly installed third-party library and build again ViSP. This could be achieved with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
\endcode

Here you can check the content of the `ViSP-third-party.txt` file and see if the newly installed 3rd party is well detected (see \ref install_centos_tips_3rd_party).

Finally, you need to rebuild ViSP with:
\code
$ make -j4
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_tips_install How to install ViSP

Installing ViSP is optional and not recommended, since ViSP could be used as a 3rd party without installation. If you still want to proceed with the installation run:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ sudo make install
\endcode
\note The default install location is set to `/usr/local`. This location could be changed modifying `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` var:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
\endcode

\note If you proceed to ViSP installation in a system folder like `/usr` or `/usr/local` there is no need to \ref install_centos_visp_dir that helps CMake to find ViSP libraries in an external project that uses ViSP as a 3rd party. If you rather install ViSP in a non "standard" folder, let say `/my/install/folder`, you have to set `VISP_DIR` to `/my/install/folder/lib/cmake/visp` that contains the `VISPConfig.cmake` file:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/install/folder
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
$ echo "export VISP_DIR=/my/install/folder/lib/cmake/visp" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_tips_uninstall How to uninstall ViSP
After ViSP installation, you can remove installed material using:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ sudo make uninstall
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_tips_modules How to build only ViSP libraries

If you want to build only ViSP modules libraries, nor the examples, tutorials and tests:
\code
$ make -j4 visp_modules
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_tips_module_once How to build a ViSP specific module

If you want to build a given module and all the dependencies:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ make -j4 visp_<module_name>
\endcode

For example to build the model-based tracker module named mbt, run:
\code
$ make -j4 visp_mbt
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_tips_target Which are the targets that could be run with make ?

To know which are the target available with `make`:
\code
$ make help | grep visp
... visp_tutorials
... visp_tests
... visp_modules
... visp_doc
... visp_examples
... visp_demos
... visp_clipper
... visp_apriltag
... visp_core
... visp_gui
... visp_imgproc
... visp_io
... gen_visp_java_source
... visp_klt
... visp_me
... visp_sensor
... visp_ar
... visp_blob
... visp_robot
... visp_visual_features
... visp_vs
... visp_vision
... visp_detection
... visp_mbt
... visp_tt
... visp_tt_mi
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_tips_3rd_party Which are the 3rd party libraries that are used in ViSP ?

To see which are the optional 3rd parties that are found during the configuration stage and that will be used by ViSP during the build you can have a look to the text file named `ViSP-third-party.txt` and located in `$VISP_WS/visp-build`. We provide hereafter an example of a possible content of this file:

\section install_centos_issues Known issues
\subsection install_centos_issues_pthread libpthread may be hidden by files in //lib64

- On CentOS 7.0 with cmake 2.8.11, during cmake configuration you may encounter the following issue:
\code
CMake Warning at src/CMakeLists.txt:80 (add_library):
   Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target visp because files in
   some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:

     runtime library [libpthread.so] in /usr/lib64 may be hidden by files in:
       //lib64

   Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
\endcode
- The problem was that libpthread.so exists in /usr/lib64 and in //lib64. In //lib64 it should be a symbolic link to /usr/lib64.
\code
$ ls -als //lib64
  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 9 Feb  4 12:16 //lib64 -> usr/lib64
$ ls -als //lib64/libpthread*
140 -rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 141616 Jan 27 15:13 //lib64/libpthread-2.17.so

  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root     18 Feb  4 12:34 //lib64/libpthread.so.0 -> libpthread-2.17.so
\endcode  
- The fix consists in removing //lib64/libpthread.so and creating a new symbolic link
\code
$ cd //lib64
$ sudo rm libpthread.so
$ sudo ln -s libpthread-2.17.so libpthread.so
$ ls -als libpthread*

  0 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root     18 Feb  4 12:34 libpthread.so.0 -> libpthread-2.17.so
\endcode

\subsection install_centos_issues_videoreader vpVideoReader is not able to read mpeg videos

- On CentOS 7.0, vpVideoReader uses OpenCV to read and decode videos. Some examples or tutorials provided in ViSP hang during cv::Capture::open() call. The reason is that OpenCV 2.4.5 cv::Capture seams buggy. This is for example the case if you run:
\code
$ ./example/video/videoReader
\endcode
- A work arround consists in installing a more recent OpenCV version from source. 

\section install_centos_next Next tutorial

You are now ready to see the next \ref tutorial-getting-started that will show you how to use ViSP as a 3rd party to build your own project.
