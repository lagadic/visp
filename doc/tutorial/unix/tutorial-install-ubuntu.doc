\page tutorial-install-ubuntu Tutorial: Installation from source for Linux Ubuntu or Debian
\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on Linux Ubuntu. These steps have been tested with Ubuntu 16.04 64bits LTS, 17.04 64bits, 18.04 64bits LTS, 18.10 64bits and Debian 9.6.0 64bits distributions, but should work with any other distribution as well.

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_ubuntu_required Install prerequisites

Prior to build and install ViSP from source, you may install GNU g++ compiler, CMake, git and subversion. This can be achieved running:
\code
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake-curses-gui git subversion wget
\endcode

\section install_ubuntu_ws Create a workspace

First create a workspace that will contain all ViSP source, build, data set and optional 3rd parties. This workspace is here set to `$HOME/visp-ws` folder, but it could be set to any other location.

In a terminal, run:
\code
$ echo "export VISP_WS=$HOME/visp-ws" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ mkdir -p $VISP_WS
\endcode

\section install_ubuntu_quick Quick ViSP installation

In this section, we give minimal instructions to build ViSP from source just to try ViSP without entering in \ref install_ubuntu_advanced.

- Install a small number of recommended 3rd parties
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev libx11-dev libeigen3-dev libxml2-dev
\endcode

- Get ViSP source code
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

- Create a build folder and build ViSP
\code
$ mkdir -p $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
$ make -j4
\endcode

- Set `VISP_DIR` environment variable
\code
$ echo "export VISP_DIR=$VISP_WS/visp-build" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

To have a trial, just jump to \ref install_ubuntu_dataset before running some binaries that you just build or jump to \ref install_ubuntu_next. You can later come back to the \ref install_ubuntu_advanced.

\section install_ubuntu_advanced Advanced ViSP installation

\subsection install_ubuntu_3rdparty Install 3rd parties

ViSP is interfaced with several optional 3rd party libraries. The <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/software-architecture">complete list is provided here</a>.

\note ViSP can be used without any third-party since all of them are optional. But obviously in this case, as we do not want to reinvent the wheel, some features implemented in third-party libraries will not be exploitable through ViSP. It is therefore possible to skip in a first time this section and start directly to \ref install_ubuntu_quick. Later, if you realize that a third-party library is missing, you can still install it, go back to the build folder, configure ViSP with CMake to detect the newly installed third-party library and build ViSP again as explained in \ref install_ubuntu_tips_new_3rdparty.

\subsubsection install_ubuntu_3rdparty_recommended Recommended 3rd parties

We recommend to install the following 3rd parties:

- OpenCV
- libX11 to be able to open a window to display images
- lapack and eigen to benefit from optimized mathematical capabilities
- libdc1394 to grab images from firewire cameras
- libv4l to grab images from usb or analogic cameras
- libxml2 to be able to configure the model-based trackers from xml files
- libzbar to be able to detect QR codes
- pthread library

Installation of recommended 3rd parties could be performed running:
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev libx11-dev liblapack-dev libeigen3-dev libdc1394-22-dev libv4l-dev libxml2-dev libzbar-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev
\endcode

\subsubsection install_ubuntu_3rdparty_realsense librealsense 2.x 3rd party

I you have an Intel RealSense Depth camera (SR300 or D400 series), you may install librealsense 2.x in order to use vpRealSense2 class. Otherwise you can skip this section.

Installation instructions are given in the <a href="https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/installation.md">tutorial</a>.

\note Since our kernel is 4.12+ streaming Depth/IR/Color is supported and is provided out of the box. This means that the patches are not needed.

Following the <a href="https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/installation.md">tutorial</a>, we recall the main steps here:

1. Get `librealsense` from github:

        $ cd $VISP_WS
        $ git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense.git
        $ cd librealsense
    
2. Ensure no Intel RealSense cameras are plugged in.

3. Install udev rules located in librealsense source directory:

        $ sudo cp config/99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
        $ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger

4. Install the packages required for librealsense build:

        $ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev pkg-config libgtk-3-dev

5. Install distribution-specific packages: 

        $ sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev (Ubuntu 16.04)
        $ sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev (Ubuntu 18.04)
	
6. Build and install librealsense

        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
        $ make -j4
        $ sudo make install

7. Connect the Realsense SR300 or D400 series camera and check if you are able to acquire images running:

        $ ./examples/capture/rs-capture

If you are able to visualize the images, it means that you succeed in librealsense installation.

\subsubsection install_ubuntu_3rdparty_flycapture FlyCapture 3rd party

FlyCapture is the SDK provided by <a href="https://www.ptgrey.com/">FLIR (previously Point Grey)</a> to work with FLIR USB 2.0, USB 3.0, Gigabit Ethernet or FireWire cameras. If you don't have such a camera you can skip this section.

Complete installation instructions are provided <a href="https://www.ptgrey.com/tan/10548">here</a>. We resume hereafter the main instructions:

1. Install the required dependencies (libraw1394-11, libgtkmm-2.4-dev, libglademm-2.4-dev, libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev, libusb-1.0) as described <a href="https://www.ptgrey.com/tan/10548">here</a>.

2. Download FlyCapture2 SDK from the <a href="https://www.ptgrey.com/support/downloads">Point Grey Downloads</a> web page. You will need a downloads account to access the Download links.

3. Unpack the software in a temporary directory.

4. Run the install script in the same directory into which you unpacked the software.

        $ sudo sh install_flycapture.sh

5. Follow the instructions of the script. This installs all the FlyCapture2 libraries, example code, sample applications, and documentation.
The script prompts you to configure udev so that devices can be used by a particular user. If you choose to configure devices, the script changes permissions on the nodes by overwriting the default Ubuntu permissions and giving the user full read and write access to the device nodes.

6. Restart your computer for the user permissions to take effect.

\subsubsection install_ubuntu_3rdparty_pylon Pylon 3rd party

The Pylon Camera Software Suite is a collection of drivers and tools for operating any <a href="https://www.baslerweb.com/en/">Basler camera</a> (IEEE1394, Camera Link, GigE or USB3.0 interface). If you don't have a Basler camera you can skip this section.

To install Pylon, visit <a href="https://www.baslerweb.com/en/support/downloads/software-downloads/">Basler Software Download</a> page to download and install the SDK corresponding to your platform.

Pylon Camera Software Suite installation enables vpPylonGrabber class usage.

\subsubsection install_ubuntu_3rdparty_franka libfranka 3rd party

I you have a Panda robot from Franka Emika, you may install libfranka in order to use vpRobotFranka class. Otherwise you can skip this section.

Installation instructions are provided following \ref franka_prereq_libfranka. There is also the \ref tutorial-franka-pbvs that explains how to install a real-time Linux kernel requested to control the robot by \ref franka_prereq_rt_linux.

\subsubsection install_ubuntu_3rdparty_other Other optional 3rd parties

We give also the way to install other 3rd party libraries to enable specific capabilities.

- If you have an Intel Realsense RGB-D camera (R200, F200, LR200, RZ300) you may install librealsense 1.12.1 following these <a href="https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/v1.12.1/doc/installation.md">installation instructions</a>.
- You may also install PCL library using:
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libpcl-dev
\endcode
- Coin, to be able to support vrml cad model used by the model-based trackers. If you are using Ubuntu 19.04 or a more recent version use
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libcoin-dev
\endcode
otherwise use rather:
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libcoin80-dev
\endcode
- libjpeg and libpng to support jpeg and png images respectively (only useful if OpenCV is not installed)
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev
\endcode
- Ogre 3D if you want to do augmented reality or simulation
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libogre-1.9-dev libois-dev
\endcode
- Datamatrix code detection
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libdmtx-dev
\endcode
- Gnu Scientific Library for addtional mathematics capabilities
\code
$ sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev
\endcode

\subsection install_ubuntu_visp_get_source Get ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code:

- You can download the <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download">latest release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using either
\code
$ tar xvzf visp-x.y.z.tar.gz -C $VISP_WS
\endcode
or
\code
$ unzip visp-x.y.z.zip -d $VISP_WS
\endcode

- You can also download a <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download#snapshot">daily snapshot</a>. Once downloaded, uncompress the file using
\code
$ tar xvzf visp-snapshot-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz -C $VISP_WS
\endcode

- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from <a href="https://github.com/lagadic/visp">GitHub repository</a> using the following command
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS
$ git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in the directory `$VISP_WS/visp`. The following should be adapted if you downloaded ViSP from a zip or tarball. In that case, the source is rather in something like `$VISP_WS/visp-x.y.z`.

\subsection install_ubuntu_visp_config Configure ViSP from source

These are the steps to configure ViSP from source with CMake:

- In the workspace, create first a directory named `visp-build` that will contain all the build material; generated Makefiles, object files, output libraries and binaries.
\code
$ mkdir $VISP_WS/visp-build
\endcode

- Enter the `visp-build` folder and configure the build:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
\endcode
A more versatile way to configure the build is to use `ccmake`, the CMake GUI:
\code
$ ccmake ../visp
\endcode
The following image shows that this command allows to configure (just by pressing [c] key) the build in a more advanced way where some options could be easily turned ON/OFF. It allows also to see which are the 3rd parties that will be used. To generate the makefiles, just press [g] key in the ccmake gui.
\image html img-ccmake-ubuntu-all.png Snapshot of the `ccmake ../visp` command used to configure ViSP.

\subsection install_ubuntu_visp_build Build ViSP libraries

To build ViSP libraries proceed with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ make -j4
\endcode

\subsection install_ubuntu_visp_doc Build ViSP documentation

To build ViSP documentation, you have first to install Doxygen package:
\code
$ sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz texlive-latex-base
\endcode
Then you can proceed with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
$ make -j4 visp_doc
\endcode
The generated documentation is then available in `$VISP_WS/visp-build/doc/html/index.html`

\note It is also possible to generate a more complete documentation that includes also all the internal classes. This could be achieved setting CMake var `ENABLE_FULL_DOC` to `ON` like:
\code
$ cmake ../visp -DENABLE_FULL_DOC=ON
$ make -j4 visp_doc
\endcode

\subsection install_ubuntu_visp_dir Set VISP_DIR environment var

In order to ease ViSP detection by CMake when ViSP is used as a 3rd party in an external project, like the one described in the \ref tutorial-getting-started, you may set `VISP_DIR` environment variable with the path to the `VISPConfig.cmake` file:
\code
$ echo "export VISP_DIR=$VISP_WS/visp-build" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

\section install_ubuntu_dataset Install ViSP data set

Some ViSP examples and tests require data (images, video, models) that are not part of ViSP source code but available in a separate archive named `visp-images-x.y.z.zip`. This archive could be downloaded from http://visp.inria.fr/download page. We provide here after the way to install these data if you want to run ViSP examples or tests. Note that ViSP tutorials are not using ViSP data set.

- Get ViSP data set and unzip the archive
\code
$ wget http://visp-doc.inria.fr/download/dataset/visp-images-3.2.0.zip --directory-prefix=$VISP_WS
$ unzip $VISP_WS/visp-images-3.2.0.zip -d $VISP_WS
\endcode

- We suppose now that the data are located in `$VISP_WS/visp-images-3.2.0`.
\code
$ ls $VISP_WS/visp-images-3.2.0
AprilTag   LICENSE.txt   calibration   cube      ellipse-1    iv     mbt         mire     video
Klimt      README.md     circle	       ellipse	 endianness   line   mbt-depth   mire-2
\endcode

- Set `VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH` environment variable to help ViSP examples and tests to find the location of the data set. It is more convenient if this environment variables is automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched: 
\code
$ echo "export VISP_WS=$HOME/visp-ws" >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo "export VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH=$VISP_WS/visp-images-3.2.0" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

- From now, you can try to run ViSP examples and tests. For example you can run `displayX` example that should open a windows with Klimt painting image and some overlay drawings:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ ./example/device/display/displayX

A click to close the windows...

A click to display a cross...
Cross position: 201, 441

A click to exit the program...
Bye
\endcode

\section install_ubuntu_tips Tips and tricks

\subsection install_ubuntu_tips_new_3rdparty How to take into account a newly installed 3rd party

Since all 3rd parties are optional you may have started to install only some of them. Imagine that you just installed a new third-party, or that you upgraded the version of this 3rd party. The next step is to go back to the build folder, configure ViSP with CMake to detect the newly installed third-party library and build again ViSP. This could be achieved with:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp
\endcode

Here you can check the content of the `ViSP-third-party.txt` file and see if the newly installed 3rd party is well detected (see \ref install_ubuntu_tips_3rd_party).

Finally, you need to rebuild ViSP with:
\code
$ make -j4
\endcode

\subsection install_ubuntu_tips_install How to install ViSP

Installing ViSP is optional and not recommended, since ViSP could be used as a 3rd party without installation. If you still want to proceed with the installation run:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ sudo make install
\endcode
\note The default install location is set to `/usr/local`. This location could be changed modifying `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` var:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
\endcode

\note If you proceed to ViSP installation in a system folder like `/usr` or `/usr/local` there is no need to \ref install_ubuntu_visp_dir that helps CMake to find ViSP libraries in an external project that uses ViSP as a 3rd party. If you rather install ViSP in a non "standard" folder, let say `/my/install/folder`, you have to set `VISP_DIR` to `/my/install/folder/lib/cmake/visp` that contains the `VISPConfig.cmake` file:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ cmake ../visp -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/install/folder
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
$ echo "export VISP_DIR=/my/install/folder/lib/cmake/visp" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
\endcode

\subsection install_ubuntu_tips_uninstall How to uninstall ViSP
After ViSP installation, you can remove installed material using:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ sudo make uninstall
\endcode

\subsection install_ubuntu_tips_modules How to build only ViSP libraries

If you want to build only ViSP modules libraries, nor the examples, tutorials and tests:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ make -j4 visp_modules
\endcode

\subsection install_ubuntu_tips_module_once How to build a ViSP specific module

If you want to build a given module and all the dependencies:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ make -j4 visp_<module_name>
\endcode

For example to build the model-based tracker module named mbt, run:
\code
$ cd $VISP_WS/visp-build
$ make -j4 visp_mbt
\endcode

\subsection install_ubuntu_tips_target Which are the targets that could be run with make ?

To know which are the target available with `make`:
\code
$ make help | grep visp
... visp_doc
... visp_modules
... visp_tutorials
... visp_demos
... visp_tests
... visp_examples
... visp_clipper
... visp_apriltag
... visp_core
... visp_gui
... visp_imgproc
... visp_io
... gen_visp_java_source
... visp_klt
... visp_me
... visp_sensor
... visp_ar
... visp_blob
... visp_robot
... visp_visual_features
... visp_vs

... visp_detection
... visp_java
... visp_java_jar
... visp_java_jar_source_copy
... visp_mbt
... visp_tt
... visp_tt_mi
\endcode

\subsection install_ubuntu_tips_3rd_party Which are the 3rd party libraries that are used in ViSP ?

To see which are the optional 3rd parties that are found during the configuration stage and that will be used by ViSP during the build you can have a look to the text file named `ViSP-third-party.txt` and located in `$VISP_WS/visp-build`. We provide hereafter an example of a possible content of this file that contains also build info.
\code
$ cat $VISP_WS/visp-build/ViSP-third-party.txt
