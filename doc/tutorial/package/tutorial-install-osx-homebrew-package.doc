\section install_osx_brew_package_tips Tips and tricks
\subsection install_osx_brew_package_build_from_source How to build from source

To install ViSP with homebrew after building from source you may run:

\code
$ brew install visp --build-from-source
\endcode

To know which are the additional build options, run:
\code
$ brew options visp
--c++11
	Build using C++11 mode
--without-gsl
	Build without gsl support
--without-libdc1394
	Build without libdc1394 support
--without-libxml2
	Build without libxml2 support
--without-opencv3
	Build without opencv3 support
--without-x11
	Build without x11 support
--without-zbar
	Build without zbar support
\endcode

For example to disable xml support, you may run

\code
$ brew install visp --build-from-source --without-libxml2
\endcode

\subsection install_osx_brew_package_not_writable /usr/local/include/visp is not writable

If during ViSP installation you get the following error

\code
$ brew install visp
...
==> Pouring visp-3.0.0.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz
Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully
The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local
Could not symlink include/visp/visp_modules.h
/usr/local/include/visp is not writable.

You can try again using:
  brew link visp
...
\endcode
it means maybe that you install other softwares without brew in /usr/local.
A work arround is to change the owner of the corresponding folder like:
\code
$ sudo chown {your-user-name} /usr/local/include
\endcode
