\section simu_image_intro Introduction

The aim of this tutorial is to explain how to use vpImageSimulator class to project an image of a planar scene at a given camera position. For example, this capability can then be used during the simulation of a visual-servo as described in \ref tutorial-ibvs to introduce an image processing. 

\section simu_image_projection Image projection

Given the image of a planar 20cm by 20cm square target as the one presented in the next image, we show here after how to project this image at a given camera position, and how to get the resulting image. 

\image html img-target-square.png Image of a planar 20cm by 20cm square target. 

This is done by the following code also available in tutorial-image-simulator.cpp:
\include tutorial-image-simulator.cpp

The result of this program is shown in the next image.

\image html img-simu-image-target-square.png Resulting projection of the planar image at a given camera position.

The provide hereafter the explanation of the new lines that were introduced.

\snippet tutorial-image-simulator.cpp Include
Include the header of the vpImageSimulator class that allows to project an image to a given camera position.

Then in the main() function we create an instance of a gray level image that corresponds to the image of the planar target, and then we read the image from the disk. 
\snippet tutorial-image-simulator.cpp Read image

Since the previous image corresponds to a 20cm by 20cm target, we initialize the 3D coordinates of each corner in the plane Z=0. Each
\snippet tutorial-image-simulator.cpp Set model

Then we create an instance of the image \c I that will contain the rendered image from a given camera position.
\snippet tutorial-image-simulator.cpp Image construction

Since the projection depends on the camera, we set its intrinsic parameters.
\snippet tutorial-image-simulator.cpp Camera parameters

We also set the render position of the camera as an homogeneous transformation between the camera frame and the target frame.
\snippet tutorial-image-simulator.cpp Set cMo

We create here an instance of the planar image projector, set the interpolation to bilinear and initialize the projector with the image of the target and the coordinates of its corners.
\snippet tutorial-image-simulator.cpp Create simulator

Now to retrieve the rendered image we first clean the content of the image to render, set the camera position, and finally get the image using the camera parameters.
\snippet tutorial-image-simulator.cpp Render image

Then, if \c libjpeg is available, the rendered image is saved in the same directory then the executable.  
\snippet tutorial-image-simulator.cpp Write image

Finally, as in \ref tutorial-getting-started we open a window to display the rendered image.

Note that this planar image projection capability has been also introduced in vpVirtualGrabber class exploited in tutorial-ibvs-4pts-image-tracking.cpp. Thus the next \ref tutorial-ibvs shows how to use it in order to introduce an image processing that does the tracking of the target during a visual-servo simulation.
