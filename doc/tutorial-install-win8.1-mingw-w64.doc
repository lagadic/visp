\tableofcontents

In this tutorial you will learn how to install ViSP from source on Windows 8.1 with Mingw-w64. These steps have been tested on Windows 8.1 (64 bit), with CMake 3.3.2 and Mingw-w64 - GCC for Windows 64 & 32 bits. 

\note Concerning ViSP installation, we provide also other \ref tutorial.

\section install_win81_mingw64_required Install prerequisities

\subsection install_win81_mingw64_required_mingw Mingw-w64

Mingw-w64 could be found following http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net. From that page, click on download "Win-builds" that will bring you to the page http://win-builds.org/download.html Here simply download and run the package manager, in our case we downloaded win-builds-1.5.0.exe file.

- Once downloaded, double click on the the exe file. It will open an installation window. 
- Select x86_64 and Mingw installation folder \c C:\\mingw as in the following image: 
\image html img-mingw64-installer-started.jpg
\note It you want to install Mingw in an other folder, you have to set MINGW_DIR environment variable to your installation location in order to allow CMake to detect 3rd party libraries that come with Mingw installer. Fo example, if you install Mingw in \c C:\\folder\\mingw-w64, setting \c MINGW_DIR is simply done running in a cmd terminal:
\code
C:> setx MINGW_DIR "C:\folder\mingw-w64"
\endcode  
- Click on "OK" button. It will open an other window:
\image html img-mingw64-installer-process.jpg
- Where you can click on "Process" button to start the installation
- A window shows the progression of the installation. When all the packages are installed you can close all the installation windows.
- To finish the installation, just add \c C:\\mingw\\bin folder to the PATH variable. To this end open a cmd terminal and do the following:
\code
C:> echo %PATH%
C:> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\mingw\bin"
\endcode
- Close and re-open a cmd terminal, then run again 
\code
C:> echo %PATH%
\endcode
to check that C:\\mingw\\bin was added.


\subsection install_win81_mingw64_required_cmake CMake

CMake 2.8.3 or higher that could be download at : http://www.cmake.org. 
- Download the latest binary distribution installer for Windows. You will find it under <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">"Windows (Win32 Installer)"</a>.
- Install CMake just by double clicking on the binary \c cmake-x.y.z-win32-x86.exe you downloaded.

\section install_win81_mingw64_3rdparty Install recommended 3rd parties

ViSP is interfaced with several 3rd party libraries. The <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/software-architecture">complete list is provided here</a>. Some of them are automatically detected since they are part of MinGW distribution. Other may be installed from source. We recommend to install the following:

\subsection install_win81_mingw64_3rdparty_opencv OpenCV 3rd party

We recommend to install OpenCV. 

- Since OpenCV is not packaged for Mingw, you have to install OpenCV from source. From http://opencv.org/downloads.html download the latest OpenCV for Windows version. In our case we install \c opencv-3.0.0.exe pre-build SDK in \c C:\\OpenCV. The installer opencv-3.0.0.exe extracted all the prebuilt binaries, <b>but also the source code</b> in \c C:\\OpenCV\\opencv.

- Now we have to use CMake to configure OpenCV from source. As \<source_dir\> we will set \c C:\\OpenCV\\opencv\\sources and as \<binary_dir\> we set \c C:\\OpenCV\\opencv\\sources\\build-mingw.
\image html img-win8.1-mingw-opencv-cmake-configure.jpg

- Click then on "Configure" button. 
- Click on "Yes" to create \c C:\\OpenCV\\opencv\\sources\\build-mingw folder.
- Select then "MinGW Makefiles" and click on "Finish" button. 
- Modify "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX" to \c C:\\OpenCV\\opencv\\build folder. This is the location of the pre-build libraries that come with the installer. Doing that, allows to install OpenCV libraries in a same parent folder.
\image html img-win8.1-mingw-opencv-cmake-configure-install.jpg
- Click then on "Configure" button to remove the red lines. 
- Click on "Generate" button to generate the Makefiles for Mingw.
- Open a cmd terminal, enter in the \<binary_dir\> folder and start mingw32-make
\code
C:\> cd C:\OpenCV\opencv\sources\build-mingw
C:\OpenCV\opencv\sources\build-mingw> mingw32-make
\endcode
\note Depending on OpenCV version you may encounter the following issues, for which we propose work arrounds;  \ref issue_win81_mingw_opencv_dtor, \ref issue_win81_mingw_opencv_tiff, or \ref issue_win81_mingw_opencv_ipp.

- To install OpenCV run:
\code
C:\OpenCV\opencv\sources\build-mingw> mingw32-make install
\endcode

- Now in order that ViSP detects OpenCV you have to set \c OpenCV_DIR environment variable. Start up cmd terminal and enter:
\code
setx OpenCV_DIR C:\OpenCV\opencv\build
\endcode
where \c C:\\OpenCV\\opencv\\build is where you have the build directory (extracted or built).  Inside this folder you should have a file named \c OpenCVConfig.cmake. 

- Here the directory is the one where you have installed OpenCV. Inside this folder you should have a file named \c OpenCVConfig.cmake. 

- You have also to add the location of OpenCV libraries in the PATH environment variable following the indications mentioned in \ref install_win81_mingw64_env_var.

\section install_win81_mingw64_install_visp Install ViSP from source code
\subsection install_win81_mingw64_get_source Getting ViSP source code

There are different ways to get ViSP source code.

- You can download the <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download">latest release</a> as a zip or a tarball. Once visp-x.y.z.tar.gz or visp-x.y.z.zip is downloaded, uncompress the file using for example <a href="http://www.win-rar.com">WinRAR</a>

- You can also download a <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/download#snapshot">daily snapshot</a>. Once visp-snapshot-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz is downloaded, uncompress the file using for example <a href="http://www.win-rar.com">WinRAR</a>

- Or you get the cutting-edge ViSP from <a href="https://github.com/lagadic/visp">GitHub repository</a> using the git command line (see \ref install_win7_tip_git):
\code
C:\ViSP> git clone https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git
\endcode

We suppose now that ViSP source is in a directory denoted  \<source_dir\>, for example \c C:\\ViSP\\visp

\subsection install_win81_mingw64_config Configuring ViSP from source 

The goal of the configuration step is now to use CMake to produce all the material requested to build ViSP with Mingw. This material will be located in \<binary_dir\>, for example \c C:\\ViSP\\visp-build.

- Launch CMake (cmake-gui) and complete the \<source_dir\> and \<binary_dir\> locations as in the next image.
\image html img-cmake-win8.1-msvc-launch.jpg 

- Click then on "Configure" button.
\image html img-cmake-win8.1-create-build-folder.jpg 

- Click on "Yes" to create the \c C:\\ViSP\\visp-build folder.
- Select then "MinGW Makefiles" and click on "Finish" button. 
\image html img-cmake-win8.1-mingw-version.jpg 

- This will start CMake configuration. As shown in the next image, OpenCV, ffmpeg, gdi, libjpeg, libpng, pthread and libxml2 3rd party are detected. 
\image html img-cmake-win8.1-mingw-configure.jpg 
\note If OpenCV is not detected, you may encounter the following issue \ref issue_win81_mingw_opencv_not_detected.

- As given in the previous image, note also that the installation folder is set to \c C:\\ViSP\\visp-build\\install. 
\warning If you want to change the installation forder to \c C:/Program \c Files \c (x86)/ViSP, make sure that you have administrator privileges to write in that folder. 

- Click then on "Configure" button. All the red lines should disappear.
\image html img-cmake-win8.1-mingw-configure-end.jpg 
\note The default configuration lead to the creation of a shared library (with \c .dll extension). This is the default configuration that is recommended. If you want to create rather a static library (with \c .lib extension) you have to uncheck the \c BUILD_SHARED_LIBS option to disable DLL creation. 

- To finish the configuration, click on "Generate" button.
\image html img-cmake-win8.1-mingw-generate.jpg 

- Once the generation is done, in \c C:/ViSP/visp-build folder you have the Makefile file that will be used by Mingw to build the entire project.

\subsection install_win81_mingw64_build Building ViSP from source

- To build ViSP, open a cmd terminal, change to \c C:\\ViSP\\visp-build folder and run mingw32-make:
\code
C:\> cd C:\ViSP\visp-build
C:\ViSP\visp-build> mingw32-make
\endcode

- Now to install ViSP, in the same cmd terminal run:
\code
C:\ViSP\visp-build> mingw32-make install
\endcode

- At the end, in \c C:/ViSP/visp-build/install/x64/mingw/bin folder you will find ViSP DLL libraries corresponding to the build modules. 
\note When CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE is set to Debug, the library names are suffixed by "d".

\subsection install_win81_mingw64_env_var Setting up PATH variable

If you built static libraries then you are done. Otherwise, if you follow this tutorial step by step you need to add the bin folders path to the systems path. This is because you will use ViSP and OpenCV libraries in form of "Dynamic-link libraries" (also known as DLL). Inside these are stored all the algorithms and information the libraries contains. The operating system will load them only on demand, during runtime. However, to do this he needs to know where they are. The systems \c PATH variable contains a list of folders where DLLs can be found. Add ViSP and OpenCV libraries path to this and the OS will know where to look if he ever needs the libraries. Otherwise, you will need to copy the used DLLs right beside the applications executable file (exe) for the OS to find it.

To modify the PATH var and add the path to ViSP library, open a cmd terminal and run:
\code
C:\> echo %PATH%
C:\> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\ViSP\visp-build\install\x64\mingw\bin"
\endcode

Then to add the path to OpenCV 3rd party library, close and re-open a cmd-terminal and run:
\code
C:\> echo %PATH%
C:\> setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\OpenCV\opencv\build\x64\mingw\bin"
\endcode

Then close and re-open a cmd terminal to check if the PATH var was well positioned

\code
C:\> echo %PATH%
\endcode


\section install_win81_mingw64_dataset Install ViSP dataset

Some ViSP examples and tests require data (images, video, models) that are not part of ViSP source code but available in a separate archive named \c ViSP-images-x.y.z.zip. This archive could be downloaded from http://visp.inria.fr/download page. We provide here after the way to install these data if you want to run ViSP examples.

Download ViSP-images-x.y.z.zip from http://visp.inria.fr/download and uncompress it for example in \c C:/ViSP.

\image html img-win8.1-visp-images.jpg 

We suppose now that the data are located in \c C:/ViSP/ViSP-images.
\code
C:\> dir ViSP/ViSP-images
Klimt	     README.md    circle  ellipse    iv    mbt   mire-2
LICENSE.txt  calibration  cube    ellipse-1  line  mire  video
\endcode

ViSP examples and tests are able to detect automatically the location of the requested data if you position an environment variable called \c VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH. In our case, this variable should be set to \c C:\\ViSP.
\code
setx VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH C:\ViSP
\endcode

\note For historical reasons \c VISP_INPUT_IMAGE_PATH should not contain the folder \c ViSP-images, but the parent folder.

From now, you can try to run ViSP examples and tests. For example, if you want to run \c \<binary dir\>/example/device/display/Debug/displayGDI.exe, open a command window, enter in the right folder, and run: 

\image html img-win8.1-mingw-cmd-displayGDI.jpg 

\section issue_win81_mingw Known issues

\subsection issue_win81_mingw_opencv_endianness OpenCV endianness failure during CMake configuration

\note This issue occurs with OpenCV 2.4.10, 2.3.0-beta and 2.3.0 releases.

If you encounter the following issue during CMake configuration
\image html img-opencv-issue-test-big-endian.jpg

Edit C:\\OpenCV\\opencv\\sources\\CMakeLists.txt file, and line 464 replace:
\code
test_big_endian(WORDS_BIGENDIAN)
\endcode
by:
\code
#test_big_endian(WORDS_BIGENDIAN)
set(WORDS_BIGENDIAN 0)
\endcode

\subsection issue_win81_mingw_opencv_tiff OpenCV build error: cannot build with tiff support

\note This issue occurs with OpenCV 2.4.10, 2.3.0-beta and 2.3.0 releases.

If you encounter a build issue during libtiff build as given in the next image:
\image html img-opencv-issue-tiff.jpg

- Open CMake GUI on OpenCV, turn BUILD_TIFF=OFF and also WITH_TIFF=OFF
- Click on "Configure" button, and then on "Generate" one.
- Build again OpenCV using
\code
C:\OpenCV\opencv\sources\build-mingw> mingw32-make
\endcode

\subsection issue_win81_mingw_opencv_ipp OpenCV link error: cannot find -lRunTmChk

\note This issue occurs with OpenCV 2.3.0-beta and 2.3.0 releases.

The following image shows the link issue that may appear when building OpenCV with mingw:
\image html img-opencv-issue-ipp.jpg

A work arround is to configure OpenCV without ipp support turning WITH_IPP=OFF and then trying to build again.

\subsection issue_win81_mingw_opencv_dtor OpenCV build error: struct has virtual functions and accessible non-virtual destructor

This error that occurs with OpenCV 3.0.0 during \c cap_dshow.cpp build is known and reported as an issue in https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/pull/5282/commits.
\image html img-win8.1-mingw-opencv-issue-dtor.jpg 

- The fix consists in modifying \c modules/videoio/src/cap_dshow.cpp by adding near line 96:
\code
#ifdef __MINGW32__
// MinGW does not understand COM interfaces
#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wnon-virtual-dtor"
#endif
\endcode

\subsection issue_win81_mingw_opencv_not_detected OpenCV not detected with Mingw build

\note This issue occurs with OpenCV 2.4.10 and 2.3.0-beta.

- To fix this issue, edit \c C:\\OpenCV\\opencv\\sources\\cmake\\OpenCVConfig.cmake, and line 89 replace:
\code
  if(CMAKE_OPENCV_GCC_TARGET_MACHINE MATCHES "64")
\endcode
by:
\code
  if(OPENCV_GCC_TARGET_MACHINE MATCHES "64")
\endcode

- Then open a new cmd terminal to build and install OpenCV again:
\code
C:\OpenCV\opencv\sources\build-mingw> mingw32-make install
\endcode
