\tableofcontents

This tutorial focuses on pinhole camera calibration. The goal of the calibration is here to estimate some camera parameters that allows to make the relation between camera's natural units (pixel positions in the image) and real world units (normalized position in meters in the image plane).

\section calibration_intro Introduction

If we denote \f$(u,v)\f$ the position of a pixel in the
digitized image, this position is related to the corresponding
coordinates \f$(x,y)\f$ in the normalized space. 

In ViSP we consider two unit conversions:
- From meters to pixels we consider the following formula:
  \f[ \begin{array}{l}
  u = u_0 + x p_x (1+k_{ud} r^2) \\ 
  v = v_0 + y p_y (1+k_{ud} r^2)
  \end{array} 
  \f]
  with \f$ r^2 = x^2+y^2 \f$ 

- From pixels to meters we consider the following formula:
  \f[ \begin{array}{l}
  x = (u-u_0)*(1+k_{du} r^2)/p_x \\
  y = (v-v_0)*(1+k_{du} r^2)/p_y 
  \end{array} 
  \f]
  with \f$ r^2=((u - u_0)/p_x)^2+((v-v_0)/p_y)^2 \f$

In this model we consider the parameters \f$(u_0,v_0,p_x,p_y, k_{ud}, k_{du})\f$ where:
- \f$(u_0, v_0)\f$ are the coordinates of the principal point in pixel;
- \f$(p_x, p_y)\f$ are the ratio between the focal length and the size of a pixel;
- \f$(k_{ud}, k_{du})\f$ are the parameters used to correct the distortion.

\note It may be useful to make a tour in \ref tutorial-bridge-opencv that makes in relation the camera model used in ViSP with the one proposed by OpenCV.

\note Note also that the container dedicated to camera parameters is implemented in the vpCameraParameters class. It allows to consider two kind of models; with or without distortion. 

The calibration process allows to estimate the values of these parameters. To this end, one of the following calibration grid can be used:
- a black and white chessboard [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/img/OpenCV_Chessboard.pdf">OpenCV_Chessboard.pdf</a>];
- a symmetrical circle pattern [<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/lagadic/visp/code/grid2d.pdf">grid2d.pdf</a>]. 

To calibrate your camera you need to take snapshots of one of these two patterns with your camera. At least 5 good snapshots of the input pattern acquired at different positions are requested for good results.

\section calibration_source_code Source code

The source code of the calibration tool is available in \c camera_calibration.cpp located in \c example/calibration folder.

We will not describe in detail the source, but just mention that:
- the image processing is performed using OpenCV;
- the estimation of the parameters is done using a virtual visual servoing scheme;
- the calibration tool takes as input a configuration file that allows to precise the kind of pattern used in the images (chessboard or circles grid), and the location of the images used as input. If \c libjpeg and \c libpng 3rd party libraries are installed and detected during ViSP configuration, you may consider .pgm, .ppm, .jpg, .png images. Default configuration files are provided in \c example/calibration folder;
- the resulting parameters are saved in \c camera.xml file. 

\section calibration_chessboard Calibration from a chessboard

In this section we consider the OpenCV chessboard pattern that has a size of 9 by 6. Each square of the chessboard is 0.025 meters large. We took 5 images called \c chessboard-01.png, \c chessboard-02.png, ..., \c chessboard-05.png. Hereafter we give an example of one of these images. 

\image html img-chessboard-01.png Snapshot example of the chessboard used to calibrate the camera.

Before starting the calibration we need to create a configuration file. We create \c default-chessboard.cfg with the following content:
\code
# Number of inner corners per a item row and column. (square, circle)
BoardSize_Width: 9
BoardSize_Height: 6

# The size of a square in meters
Square_Size: 0.025

# The type of pattern used for camera calibration. 
# One of: CHESSBOARD or CIRCLES_GRID
Calibrate_Pattern: CHESSBOARD

# The input image sequence to use for calibration
Input: chessboard-%02d.png

# Tempo in seconds between two images. If > 10 wait a click to continue
Tempo: 1
\endcode

\note The images and the configuration file used in this tutorial are available in ViSP source code and copied in the same folder than the \c camera_calibration binary. 

To estimate the camera parameters, just enter in ViSP \c \<binary_dir\>/examples/calibration and run:
\code
./camera_calibration default-chessboard.cfg
\endcode

This command will produce the following output:
\code
grid width : 9

\section calibration_circle Calibration from a circles grid

In this section we consider the ViSP symmetric circles grid pattern that has a size of 6 by 6. Each circle center of gravity is 0.034 meters distant from it's horizontal or vertical neighbor. We took 5 images called \c circles-01.pgm, \c circles-02.pgm, ..., \c circles-05.pgm. Hereafter we give an example of such an image. 

\image html img-circles-grid-02.png Snapshot example of the symmetric circles grid used to calibrate the camera.

\endcode

The resulting parameters are also saved in \c ./camera.xml file.


\section calibration_undistort Distorsion removal

Once the camera is calibrated, you can remove the distortion in the images. The following example available in tutorial-undistort.cpp shows how to do it.

\include tutorial-undistort.cpp

In this example we first load the image \c chessboard.pgm
\snippet tutorial-undistort.cpp Load image

Then we read the camera parameters with distortion of a camera named "Camera" from \c ./camera.xml file. This is only possible if ViSP was build with \c libxml2 3rd party support. 

\snippet tutorial-undistort.cpp Load camera parameters from xml

If vpXmlParserCamera is not available (this may occur if ViSP was not build with \c libxml2), we initialize the camera parameters "by hand" using the following code:
\snippet tutorial-undistort.cpp Set camera parameters

Finally, we create a new image \c Iud where distortion is removed. This image is saved in \c chessboard-undistort.pgm.

\snippet tutorial-undistort.cpp Create image without distorsion

The resulting \c chessboard-undistort.pgm image is the following.

\image html img-chessboard-undistort.png \c chessboard-undistort.pgm image where distortion was removed.
