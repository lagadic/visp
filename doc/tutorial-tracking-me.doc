\section tracking_me_line Line tracking

With ViSP you can track a line using moving edges. The following example code available in tutorial-me-line-tracker.cpp shows how to use ViSP vpMeLine class to this end.

\include tutorial-me-line-tracker.cpp

The video shows the result of the tracking:

Here after we explain line by line the program.

Images that are processed could be acquired from a firewire camera on Unix or Windows, of from an usb camera under Unix. That is allowed by including the grabber headers.

\code
#include <visp3/sensor/vp1394CMUGrabber.h>
#include <visp3/sensor/vp1394TwoGrabber.h>
#include <visp3/sensor/vpV4l2Grabber.h>
\endcode

To display these images we then include the headers of the viewers.

\code
#include <visp3/core/vpDisplayGDI.h>
#include <visp3/core/vpDisplayX.h>
\endcode

The Graphical Display Interface (GDI) allows to display images under Windows, while X11 allows this feature under unix-like systems. 

Finally, to track a line with the moving edges, we include the header of the vpMeLine class.

\code
#include <visp3/core/vpMeLine.h>
\endcode
 
In the main() function, The source code is build only if one of the grabbers and one of the viewers is available.

\code
#if (defined(VISP_HAVE_DC1394) || defined(VISP_HAVE_CMU1394) || defined(VISP_HAVE_V4L2)) && (defined(VISP_HAVE_X11) || defined(VISP_HAVE_GDI))
\endcode

Here we create a gray level image container \c I that will contain the images acquired by our camera.

\code
vpImage<unsigned char> I;
\endcode

Then, we create a grabber instance, first for a firewire camera under Unix if libdc1394 3rd party is installed, secondly for a firewire camera under Windows if CMU1394 3rd party is installed, and lastly for an usb camera under Unix if none of the previous 3rd party are installed, and if libv4l is installed. The \ref tutorial-grabber gives more details concerning the framegrabbing.

\code
#if defined(VISP_HAVE_DC1394)
  vp1394TwoGrabber g(false);
#elif defined(VISP_HAVE_CMU1394)
  vp1394CMUGrabber g;
#elif defined(VISP_HAVE_V4L2)
  vpV4l2Grabber g;     
#endif
\endcode

We then open the connection with the grabber and acquire an image in \c I.
\code
  g.open(I);
  g.acquire(I);
\endcode

To be able to display image \c I and the tracking results in overlay in a window, we create a display instance.
\code
#if defined(VISP_HAVE_X11)
  vpDisplayX d(I, 0, 0, "Camera view");
#else
  vpDisplayGDI d(I, 0, 0, "Camera view");
#endif
\endcode

Then we display the image in the window created previously.
\code
  vpDisplay::display(I);
  vpDisplay::flush(I);
\endcode

We then initialize the moving edges parameters used later by the tracker. From the previous position of a moving edge, we are tracking its new position along the normal of the contour with a range of 25 pixels. For each pixel along the normal we will compute the oriented convolution. The pixel that will be selected by the moving edges algorithm will be the one that has a convolution higher than 15000. Between two consecutive moving edges on the contour we keep a space of 10 pixels.
\code
  vpMe me;
  me.setRange(25);
  me.setThreshold(15000);
  me.setSampleStep(10);
\endcode

We then, create an instance of the vpMeTracker class that will track our line.
We initialize the tracker with the previous moving-egdes parameters. We allow also the tracker to display additional information on the viewer overlay. The user has than to initialize the tracker on image \c I by clicking on two points located on the line to track. 
\code
  vpMeLine line;
  line.set Me(&me);
  line.set Display(vpMeSite::RANGE_RESULT);
  line.initTracking(I);
\endcode

Once the tracker is initialized, we enter in a while loop where we successively acquire a new image, display it, track the line, display the tracking results and finally flush the overlay drawings in the viewer.
\code
  while(1) {
    g.acquire(I); 
    vpDisplay::display(I);
    line.track(I);
    line.display(I, vpColor::red);
    vpDisplay::flush(I);
  }
\endcode


\section tracking_me_ellipse Ellipse tracking

With ViSP you can also track an ellipse using moving edges. The following example code available in tutorial-me-ellipse-tracker.cpp shows how to use ViSP vpMeEllipse class to this end.

\include tutorial-me-ellipse-tracker.cpp

The video shows the result of the tracking:

\htmlonly
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IK-VgFyK_Tc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
\endhtmlonly

This example is very similar to the one presented in \ref tracking_me_line. It differs only in the name of the class and its header that is used to allow ellipse tracking:

\code
  vpMeEllipse ellipse;
  ellipse.setMe(&me);
  ellipse.setDisplay(vpMeSite::RANGE_RESULT);
  ellipse.initTracking(I);
\endcode

Note here that the user has to initialize the tracker on image \c I by clicking on five points located on the ellipse to track.
