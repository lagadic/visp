                "Hello World" example based on CMake


This example shows how to exploit the ViSP library to build the "Hello World"
example based on CMake configuration tools.

Prior to use ViSP as a third party library you need a compiled (build) version
of ViSP source code. We suppose here that ViSP is build in <visp_build_dir>. 
ViSP library is than in <visp_build_dir>/lib/libvisp.[a,so,lib,dll].

Under Unix, you can build this project using ViSP as a third party library 
using: 

ccmake .
  [hit 'c' key to configure the project]
  [hit 'e' key to acknoledge the warning indicating that ViSP is not found]
  [Use the arrow keys to position the cursor on the VISP_DIR line] 
  [Press "ENTER" key to enter in the edit mode]
  [Set VISP_DIR variable to the "<visp_build_dir>/lib" location]
  [Press "ENTER" key to quit the edit mode]
  [hit 'c' key to configure the project]
  [hit 'c' key to configure the project]
  [hit 'g' key to generate the Makefiles]

Than you can compile this project by:

make

That's all under Unix

Under Windows, you need to start CMake GUI and than:
- set the "Hello World" source code location
- set the build path for example to the same location
- click on "Configure" button
- select your build tool in the list [Visual Studio 2003 for example]
- set the VISP_DIR variable to the "<visp_build_dir>/lib" location
- click on "Configure" button
- click on "Ok" button or "Generate" button
- CMake GUI will exit automatically when configuration files are generated 

Than open your solution like "HelloWorld.sln" in you build tool to compile
the Hello World project.

That's all under Windows
