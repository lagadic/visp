      per module named libvisp_<module>. Keep compat with previous releases.
    . Allow to link contributions to ViSP source code using
      VISP_CONTRIB_MODULES_PATH CMake var;
      see http://github.com/lagadic/visp_contrib
    . Model-based tracker:
      + New visibility tests based on the scanline rendering algorithm.
      + Improve Ogre3D visibility tests in order to use it in a probalistic
        approach via the setNbRayCastingAttemptsForVisibility()
        and setGoodNbRayCastingAttemptsRatio() functions.
      + Introduction of cylinder tracking with the model-based trackers using
        key points.
      + Improve the setPose() functionnality to use the given pose as a
        prediction of the key points position while using vpMbKltTracker and
        vpMbEdgeKltTracker.
    . Introduce vpArray2D template class that is inherited by all matrices and
      vectors.

        query keypoints are matched to the same train keypoints).

        useful when we learn only on one image, it allows to avoid to match
        background keypoints with train keypoints).
      + Optimize the FLANN matching by learning once the train descriptors
        instead of doing it at each call of the matching function (noticeable
        with large train descriptors).
      + Add possibility to use the FLANN matcher with binary descriptors.
      + Fix displayMatching function and fix small memory leak in loadLearningData.
      + Should be possible to read / write learning files in binary mode regardless
        of the endianness of the host (need to be tested on a real case).

        the data type).

    - New vpViper650 and vpRobotViper650 classes to interface Inria's new
      Adept Viper s650 robot.
    - New robot simulators; vpSimulatorCamera, vpSimulatorPioneer,
      vpSimulatorPioneerPan

    - Fix typos detected by lintian
    - Add support for multiarch. Multiarch is the ability for a library
      to be installed concurrently for differents architectures (such as

      assumption made that libraries are installed in $INSTALL_PREFIX/lib and
      binaries in $INSTALL_PREFIX/bin.
    - In vp1394TwoGrabber that allows to grab images from firewire cameras,
      cameras are powered off when the grabber is closed.

      __declspec(thread) with vpDisplayGDI it is possible to open only
      one display.
    - To better organise the code, robot simulators inherit from
      vpRobotSimulator class. Introduction of a new vpRobotWireFrameSimulator
      class as a base class of robot simulated using the wireframe display
      capabilities.

     - All initClick() now have a non-blocking equivalent as initFromPoints(),
       or initFromPose(), etc.
     - Most of the classes that had a display() method now have the equivalent
       display in static function (display's externalisation).
     - Ransac is now improved for either pose computation or point matching.

ViSP 2.4.2 (released March 27th, 2008)
  - New classes
    - vpCalibration : calibration toolkit for intrinsic and
        extrinsic parameters of perspective camera.
    - vpXmlParserCamera : Parser xml to read and save camera parameters
        from vpCameraParameters class.
    - vpHinkley : Hinkley's cumulative sum test computation.
    - vpMePath  : Tracking of a white curve by using line and parabola
        tracker.
    - vpKeyboard : Gets a key from the keyboard without waiting for the
        enter key.
    - vpParallelPort : Parallel port management under unix.
    - vpRingLight : Irisa's ring light controller.
    - vpKltOpencv : Interface for the KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) feature
        tracker implemented with opencv.
  - New Features
  - Bug fix and improvement
    - vpCameraParameters : support for radial distortion camera model.
    - vpAfma6 : Add a getCameraParameters functionnality
    - vpSimulator : either SoWin or SoQt or SoXt is needed to use
        vpSimulator class.
    - vpDot: setMaxDotSize(double percentage) replace
        setNbMaxPoint(double nb) to be less image size dependent.
        The maximal dot size is set by default to 0.25% (quarter image size).
        setGrayLevelPrecision(double grayLevelPrecision) has been
        added for a better management of gray dots detection.
    - vpDot2:
        Changes in searchDotsInArea() :
          The algorithm search now in the bounding boxes of the bad dots.
          Bug fixed : we could fall in an infinite loop.
          Split accuracy private variable into grayLevelPrecision and
          sizePrecision. The gray level min and max are well calculated for
          white and black dots.
        Add setEllipsoidShapePrecision() to turn on/off and modify the test
        related of the geometry of the shape
    - vpDisplayX : better management of endianness
    - vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D, vpDisplayX :
        To actually display drawings on the screen, a vpDisplay::flush(I) is
        needed. Use it with parsimony : it is time consuming.
    - vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D :
        The behavior of the following methods change to be similar
        to vpDisplayX:
        . getClick(..., button) : The button used to click is now an output
        . getClickUp(..., button) : The button used to click is now an output
        Moreover, in vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D middle button is now managed
    - vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D :
        The usage of display->init(vpImage, int, int); returned a
        segmentation fault : bug fixed
    - vpDisplayD3D : we couldn't re-use a display after the call of the
        function close(vpImage). We had a black image : bug fixed.
    - vpDisplay : changes in displayRectangle():an option parameter
        fill has been had to precise if the displayed rectangle is filled
        or not.
    - vpColor : Add orange color.
    - vpServo : To fix bug #3528 you should explicitly call vpServo::kill()
        in your programs. Otherwise an exception
        vpServoException::notKilledProperly is launched by
        vpServo::~vpServo() destructor.
    - vpMatrix : Change Infinity Norm and Euclidian Norm formula to match with
	the standard matrix norms definitions.
        Change determinant formula for 3x3 matrices to match with
        the standard determinant definition.
    - vpImageConvert :
	Add IplImage to vpImage and vpImage to IplImage conversion tool.
	Add MONO16 to grey (MONO8) conversion tool.
    - vp1394TwoGrabber :
	Supports libdc1394-2.0.0-rc7 and libdc1394-2.0.1
	MONO16 color coding is supported
  - Testing and examples:
    - example/calibration/calibrate2dGrid.cpp was added

	  directly from the build dir, or from the install dir, or
	  from a package (NSIS, ...)
	- vpRobotCamera It is now possible to add a sampling time so that
          the behavior of this simulated camera is quite realistic. This
	  sampling time is set by default to 40 ms.
	- vpExponentialMap A sampling time was introduced.
  - Bug fix and improvement
	- vpImage: getWidth() and getHeight() replace getCols() and getRows()
	  which are now obsolete.
	- More restrictive types in vpImage, vpDisplay..., and vp...Grabber
	  classes: const are added, unsigned int replace int for pixel
	  manipulations and image or display size.
	- In vpDisplay classes:
	  . vpMouseButton::vpMouseButtonType was introduced to handle
	    mouse clicks
	  . vpColor::vpColorType was introduced to handle colors to display
	- Simulator functionality based on Coin usage is now available
	  under windows. It allows the use of vpSimulator class under this
	  platform.
