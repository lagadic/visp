ViSP 2.4.x
  - New classes
  - New Features
  - Bug fix and improvement
	- vpDot: setMaxDotSize(double percentage) replace 
	  setNbMaxPoint(double nb) to be less image size dependent.
	  The maximal dot size is set by default to 0.25% (quarter image size)
	- vpDot2: Changes in searchDotsInArea() :
	    The algorithm search now in the boundingboxes of the bad dots.
	    Bug fixed : we could fall in an infinite loop.
	    Split accuracy private variable into grayLevelPrecision and 
	  sizePrecision. The gray level min and max are well calculated for 
	  white and black dots.
	- vpDisplayX : better management of endianness
	- vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D : 
	  The behavior of the following methods change to be similar
	  to vpDisplayX:
	  . getClick(..., button) : The button used to click is now an output
	  . getClickUp(..., button) : The button used to click is now an output
	  Moreover, in vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D middle button is now managed
	- vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D :
	  The usage of display->init(vpImage, int, int); returned a 
	  segmentation fault : bug fixed
	- vpDisplayD3D : we couldn't re-use a display after the call of the 
	  function close(vpImage). We had a black image : bug fixed.
	- vpDisplay : changes in displayRectangle():an option parameter 
	  fill has been had to precise if the displayed rectangle is filled 
	  or not. 
  - Testing:
	- test/video-device/testClick.cpp was added
  - Documentation improvement
	- vpRobotAfma6: example usage of getPosition() was updated
	- vpDisplayGDI is included in the doxygen documentation
----------------------------------------------	
ViSP 2.4.1 (released May 16, 2007)
  - New classes
        - vpRect class for rectangle manipulations, display	
        - vpHistogram,vpHistogramPeak and vpHistogramValey classes to
	  handle gray level image histogram
	- vpSubPixel for sub-pixel manipulations	
	- vpMouseButton for mouse click identification	
  - New Features
        - MinGW supported
	- ViSP as a third party library in an other project.
	  It is now possible to use ViSP as a third party project without
	  installing ViSP by make install. ViSP can now be used
	  directly from the build dir, or from the install dir, or
	  from a package (NSIS, ...)
	- vpRobotCamera It is now possible to add a sampling time so that
          the behavior of this simulated camera is quite realistic. This 
	  sampling time is set by default to 40 ms.
	- vpExponentialMap A sampling time was introduced.	
  - Bug fix and improvement
	- vpImage: getWidth() and getHeight() replace getCols() and getRows() 
	  which are now obsolete.
	- More restrictive types in vpImage, vpDisplay..., and vp...Grabber 
	  classes: const are added, unsigned int replace int for pixel 
	  manipulations and image or display size.
	- In vpDisplay classes:	
	  . vpMouseButton::vpMouseButtonType was introduced to handle
	    mouse clicks 
	  . vpColor::vpColorType was introduced to handle colors to display
	- Simulator functionality based on Coin usage is now available
	  under windows. It allows the use of vpSimulator class under this
	  platform.
	- Compatibility with Windows platform.
	- Reference documentation improvement
	- cfox and std namespace were removed. To use cout you need to call 
	  std::cout, std::endl, std::cin ...
----------------------------------------------	
ViSP 2.4.0 (released February 6, 2007)
  - New Feature
	- add new framegrabber interface for itifg8 driver from Coreco 
	  Imaging Technology (http://sourceforge.net/projects/itifg)
	  Tested with AM-STD COMP framegrabber board on 2.4 and 2.6
	  linux kernel (see vpItifg8Grabber). 
	- add new framegrabber interface and test for firewire 1394 
	  cameras using libdc1394-2.x. Need a newer version than 
	  libdc1394-2.0.0-rc4.
	  Tested with the svn version of libdc1394-2 and Marlin F033C and
          F131B cameras (see vp1394TwoGrabber). Format 7 is supported
	  in vp1394TwoGrabber.
	  vp1394Grabber will be obsolete soon.
