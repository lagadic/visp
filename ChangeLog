ViSP 2.4.2 (released March 27, 2008)
  - New classes
    - vpCalibration : calibration toolkit for intrinsic and 
        extrinsic parameters of perspective camera.
    - vpXmlParserCamera : Parser xml to read and save camera parameters 
        from vpCameraParameters class. 
    - vpHinkley : Hinkley's cumulative sum test computation.
    - vpMePath  : Tracking of a white curve by using line and parabola 
        tracker.
    - vpKeyboard : Gets a key from the keyboard without waiting for the 
        enter key.
    - vpParallelPort : Parallel port management under unix.
    - vpRingLight : Irisa's ring light controller.
    - vpKltOpencv : Interface for the KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) feature 
        tracker implemented with opencv.
  - New Features
  - Bug fix and improvement
    - vpCameraParameters : support for radial distortion camera model.
    - vpAfma6 : Add a getCameraParameters functionnality
    - vpSimulator : either SoWin or SoQt or SoXt is needed to use 
        vpSimulator class.
    - vpDot: setMaxDotSize(double percentage) replace 
        setNbMaxPoint(double nb) to be less image size dependent.
        The maximal dot size is set by default to 0.25% (quarter image size).
        setGrayLevelPrecision(double grayLevelPrecision) has been 
        added for a better management of gray dots detection.
    - vpDot2: 
        Changes in searchDotsInArea() :
          The algorithm search now in the bounding boxes of the bad dots.
          Bug fixed : we could fall in an infinite loop.
          Split accuracy private variable into grayLevelPrecision and 
          sizePrecision. The gray level min and max are well calculated for 
          white and black dots.
        Add setEllipsoidShapePrecision() to turn on/off and modify the test 
        related of the geometry of the shape
    - vpDisplayX : better management of endianness
    - vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D, vpDisplayX :
        To actually display drawings on the screen, a vpDisplay::flush(I) is 
        needed. Use it with parsimony : it is time consuming.
    - vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D : 
        The behavior of the following methods change to be similar
        to vpDisplayX:
        . getClick(..., button) : The button used to click is now an output
        . getClickUp(..., button) : The button used to click is now an output
        Moreover, in vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D middle button is now managed
    - vpDisplayGTK, vpDisplayGDI, vpDisplayD3D :
        The usage of display->init(vpImage, int, int); returned a 
        segmentation fault : bug fixed
    - vpDisplayD3D : we couldn't re-use a display after the call of the 
        function close(vpImage). We had a black image : bug fixed.
    - vpDisplay : changes in displayRectangle():an option parameter 
        fill has been had to precise if the displayed rectangle is filled 
        or not. 
    - vpColor : Add orange color.
    - vpServo : To fix bug #3528 you should explicitly call vpServo::kill()
        in your programs. Otherwise an exception 
        vpServoException::notKilledProperly is launched by 
        vpServo::~vpServo() destructor.
    - vpMatrix : Change Infinity Norm and Euclidian Norm formula to match with 
	the standard matrix norms definitions.
        Change determinant formula for 3x3 matrices to match with 
        the standard determinant definition.
    - vpImageConvert : 
	Add IplImage to vpImage and vpImage to IplImage conversion tool.
	Add MONO16 to grey (MONO8) conversion tool.
    - vp1394TwoGrabber :
	Supports libdc1394-2.0.0-rc7 and libdc1394-2.0.1
	MONO16 color coding is supported
