    . Compatibility with Odroid XU4
    . Source code migrates to GitHub: http://github.com/lagadic/visp
    . Introduce Travis continuous integration
    . New website: http://visp.inria.fr
    . Reorganize source in modules (core, vision, mbt, tt, …) with a library
      per module named libvisp_<module>. Keep compat with previous releases.
    . Allow to link contributions to ViSP source code using
      VISP_CONTRIB_MODULES_PATH CMake var;
      see http://github.com/lagadic/visp_contrib
    . Model-based tracker:
      + New visibility tests based on the scanline rendering algorithm.
      + Improve Ogre3D visibility tests in order to use it in a probalistic
        approach via the setNbRayCastingAttemptsForVisibility()
        and setGoodNbRayCastingAttemptsRatio() functions.
      + Introduction of cylinder tracking with the model-based trackers using
        key points.
      + Improve the setPose() functionnality to use the given pose as a
        prediction of the key points position while using vpMbKltTracker and
        vpMbEdgeKltTracker.
    . Introduce vpArray2D template class that is inherited by all matrices and
      vectors.

      + Add OpenMP support for Affine SIFT.
      + Add single matching filter (discard pairs of keypoints where multiple
        query keypoints are matched to the same train keypoints).
      + Add possibility to match train keypoints to query keypoints (could be
        useful when we learn only on one image, it allows to avoid to match
        background keypoints with train keypoints).
      + Optimize the FLANN matching by learning once the train descriptors
        instead of doing it at each call of the matching function (noticeable
        with large train descriptors).
      + Add possibility to use the FLANN matcher with binary descriptors.
      + Fix displayMatching function and fix small memory leak in loadLearningData.
      + Should be possible to read / write learning files in binary mode regardless
        of the endianness of the host (need to be tested on a real case).
      + Save learning files in XML mode with the full precision (according to
        the data type).

      it is now possible to turn off the default usage of the library.
    - Warning during the build if deprecated functions are used
    - For the Irisa's Afma6 robot addition of a new vacuum tool (vpAfma6).
    - New vpImagePoint class for image point coordinates.
    - New vpPlot class that enables real time drawing of graphics under Unix.
    - Ability to use other colors than the predefined ones with the rewriting
      of the vpColor class and modifications in display functionalities.
    - New vpKalmanFilter and vpLinearKalmanFilterInstantiation classes with
      velocity and acceleration state models.
    - New vpFeatureTranslation: ctc*
    - New USE_COIN_SIMULATOR option during CMake configuration to enable or
      disable simulation capabilities based on Coin3D suite.
    - New vpViper, vpViper850 and vpRobotViper850 classes to provide an
      interface for Inria's Adept Viper 850 robot.
    - New vpBSpline and vpNurbs classes to manipulate 2D BSpline and
      2D Nurbs (Non Uniform Rational BSpline).
    - New vpMeNurbs class to track object edges.
    - New vpFFMPEG class to interface the FFmpeg library.
    - New vpVideoReader and vpVideoWriter classes to manipulate easily the

  - Improvements
    - In firewire framegrabbing using vp1394TwoGrabber based on libdc1394-2.x,
      bus reset can be switched off in the constructor. There are also
      improvements in the acquisition using acquire(vpImage<unsigned char> &I,
      ...) by removing the color coding format request and by support of the
      RAW8 and RAW16 video format.
      New dequeue() functions were also introduced to make possible to
      separate the ring buffer dequeuing and enqueuing. This behavior
      is for example useful when image processing needs to be introduced
      between the dequeuing and enqueuing stages. It may also useful
      to synchronise the image acquisition with an other sensor.
      New setPanControl() function was introduced to set the PAN register
      0x884 to control single or multiple image transmission from stereo
      vision cameras like the PointGrey Bumblebee.
    - vpDot2: The tracking is restarted in vpDot2::track() if a dot is found
      but is not valid.
    - In vpDisplay, new getKeyboardEvent() functionality to handle key
      events and new getPointerMotionEvent() functionality to handle mouse
      pointer motion event.
    - Optimization of the vpMatrix class.
  - Examples:
    - New examples in examples/servo-viper850 to show how to use the
      linear Kalman filter to compensate the tracking error due to the
      motion of a target.
    - New examples in examples/servo-viper850 to show how to use the
      secondary task to avoid joint limits.
    - New plotting example in example/tools/plot.cpp
    - In grab1394Two.cpp example, addition of [-r] new option to reset the bus.
    - New examples to show how to build a 3D visual servoing without using the
      vpServo and vpFeature classes:
      servoSimu3D_cMcd_CamVelocityWithoutVpServo.cpp
      and servoSimu3D_cdMc_CamVelocityWithoutVpServo.cpp
